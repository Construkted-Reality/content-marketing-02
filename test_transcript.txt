In this digital age,
Where the world is at our fingertips.
We're dreamers. We're believers.
Reaching for the stars. Yeah.
With
our
possibilities.
>> Hello
ladies and gentlemen and everything in
between.
All right.
Welcome, welcome to the future fiction
academy.
>> My name is Eello Heritton. This is the
premier place where you you that means
you
get to learn everything there is to know
about AI and
future and future and the future of
writing. Uh I still am not growing out a
beard. I promise I'm still not. I just
have been incredibly lazy. And by this
time tomorrow when we have our big
Friday night live stream, ladies and
gentlemen, I will probably be nice and
bald and less like uh Mr. Zippity Dooah
guy from uh the um from the movies.
Even though I do like singing Zippity
Dooah because you know me. Anyway, so
ladies and gentlemen, this has been a
crazy
crazy
week. Uh, as a matter of fact, it's been
so crazy that I have uh I'm going to
have to probably have an expert in here
to help me sort through all of this
information. But before we do that, I
want to make sure you all know that the
reason we are here is because of the
Future Fiction Academy. We are the
premier place where you get to learn
about artificial intelligence and
creativity. Whether that be writing your
first novel or your 50th novel, whether
that be creating your own book covers or
no book covers at all, maybe just
mocking stuff up so you can give it off
to somebody who makes who is much more
creative than you. We are here to show
you how to take all of these tools that
we have at our fingertips and make your
dreams come true. That is what we're
here for. And I hope to goodness that
you are here for that, too. Now, I uh
the the academy is we have tons of stuff
going on. uh more things than you know,
but one of the most important things
right now is our accelerator. If you
want to get into our mastermind, this is
the gateway to the mastermind. Now, the
gateway to the mastermind means that
once you are done with your accelerator
course, you will be in the mastermind
from that moment on. Okay? And what is
the mastermind? It is well, I have to
tell you, it's it's pretty great. It's a
like-minded individuals who are all here
to help each other make the best of this
writing experience with AI and this new
paradigm of having a business that
you're running with AI. We all get
together, we all talk about things, and
we even teach a bunch of classes every
week, three or four classes a week. Uh,
one of which was mine this week. Uh, and
we teach people actionable things that
help them actually
make their business go to the next level
or write their first novel or any of
that stuff. and we show you how to do it
all with the assistance of artificial
intelligence. So, if you want to join
the accelerator, which is our August
cohort for the accelerator, you can get
that value for $249 a month. But not
only that, we have lots of standalone
classes, including things like
publishing uh a publishing niche through
AI. We have easy peasy book machine,
build it, bend it, and break it down. We
have the incomparable Harpers uh a
romance outlines with AI, which if you
haven't, if you've tried to write
romance with artificial intelligence,
then you know exactly what I'm talking
about right now, that you need
some kind of guidance on how to get that
AI to do what you want it to do. We have
things like translations which is a big
course that we have and that course is
so that you can take that thing that
you've already made and disseminated out
two or three or maybe even four
different ways. So that's what all of
that is. But what we really have a
cooking
is your first draft. And as a matter of
fact, we're even going to talk to one of
the creators of your first draft today.
But I get ahead of myself again. Ladies
and gentlemen, if you want to get
involved with your first draft, there's
really only one way to do it, and that
is through the YFD boot camp. Now, how
much is the YFD boot camp? The YFD boot
camp is a $300 value. And what do you
get with it? You get four credits of uh
to be applied in your first draft. Your
first draft works on a credit system.
And as you purchase more credits, you
get to make more chapters. So the first
credit is good. I think we have a half
credit I think um with uh short
novellas. So it's like 10 uh chapters
and then we have one credit for 20
chapters, two credits for 40 chapters
and so on and so forth. Okay? You can
purchase as many of uh uh credits as you
want as long as you get in the class.
And why are we making a class available
to you? Come on now. We want you to be
able to understand exactly how
everything inside of the uh uh inside of
the um software, how it all works. When
this kind of helps us minimize the
amount of uh questions that uh probably
could be answered through a nice little
course like the class, the YFD boot
camp. So, do me a favor. Go over uh
actually do me a favor. Click the links
below and that'll take you right over
there and you can look at the at your
first draft all on your own. Uh if you
stick around till halfway through,
we're going to talk a little bit more
about the boot camp. I have an actual
thing pulled up so that we can look at
the boot camp and what's involved and
all of the stuff that's involved. So, if
you wanted to get involved inside the
boot camp. Now,
now that all of that's done,
y'all, it's been a busy week, and I mean
a busy week. Anthropic drops 4.1 Opus.
Google
decides to drop a world model where, and
we had a a live stream about that world
model on Tuesday. So, if you want to,
please go over to our Tuesday live
stream and take a look at that. It's
crazy to me that you can walk around a
universe in which you put the picture in
or you write out the uh prompt and it
creates a universe for you to walk
around and you get about a minute or
something like that. But think, think,
remember what's the thing I always say?
This is the worst that it's ever going
to be. So, it's going to get better and
better and better. And those tools will
be available to you as an author and you
will be able to create all kinds of
bonus content for your readers. It's
amazing. But then then open AAI said
hold my
lunch pale.
They released an open-source model, not
one but two, which if we get an
opportunity, we will play around with
today. And I don't know if we have
access to GPT5 today, but Lynn, if
you're listening, you owe me I don't
know, was it a a a drink or something
like that or a dinner? I can't remember
which what our what our uh bet was, but
GPT5.
We have GPT5, ladies and gentlemen. Just
amazing. now
to help me sort through all of this
stuff. Actually, before we do that, let
me say hello to Oh, Ross is here. How
you doing? Good day. Good day to you,
Ross.
How you doing? I know I have the worst
worst Australian accent. And uh
Plumestone, hey y'all. Good to see you,
too. And we're up to 21 people watching
this live stream right now. I am excited
about all of you people being here, too.
I appreciate you all and I appreciate
the fact that you all still keep coming
and coming and coming to the Future
Fiction Academy.
now today to sort through all of this
stuff, all of these announcements,
everything that we have been like going
through for the past four days. It's
only been it's only Thursday,
but to uh all of these um these things
that we have been uh dealing with, I
bring to the stage for the first time
one of the one of the uh big cheeses at
the Future Fiction Academy. He helped I
actually he spearheaded the creation of
Raparite. He has helped develop
so many tools including Rexi 2.0 and
Rexi and all of these things if it
wasn't for this man right here. We would
not have the robust
ecosystem that we get to enjoy. his name
and I appreciate all of you giving him a
nice golf clap wherever you are. I bring
to the stage Joseph. How you doing,
Joseph?
>> Hey, Kell. Doing good, thanks.
>> Good, good. I know this isn't your cup
of tea. This isn't what you usually do.
I know this for a fact that you aren't
usually here in front of people and
talking and all of that stuff. So, I
really do appreciate you showing up
today.
>> Yeah. No, happy to be here. And uh just
to touch on some of the you were saying
chat GPT5, where's it at? Right. So,
it's available right now. If you've got
playground, you probably got it in your
playground. You don't have it in your
chat GPT yet. Easier than playground
probably right now. Go into open router.
You have access.
>> Yeah. Actually, what I wanted to do
>> Yeah. What I want to do today, Joseph,
is uh I'm gonna pull up playground. Um,
and could you kind of help me through
this cuz I this new paradigm and the way
that they've set everything up now is
completely different and I would assume
you've had a little time to like mess
around with it a little bit.
>> Oh yeah, it's been like uh like they
they just made available I think like a
little less than an hour ago. But uh
>> No, I'm talking about the new
>> Oh, just their their like weird
formatting that they
>> Yeah. Yeah. The new weird formatting.
>> Yeah. like they took away the
playground, but then they still call it
the playground and you can click on it.
The easiest way to go is to the I think
there's like a model page or here. Let
me let me give you Am I able to just let
me I'm just going to join the chat here.
>> No, no, no, no, no, not not the big
chat. Do the private chat on the side.
>> Ah, private chat. Okay. I wasn't going
to give anything sense.
>> No, no, no, no, no. I just it would just
be easier.
>> Just jump on over. Yeah. It doesn't clog
up the
um
>> the comments and stuff. Yeah.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Uh GPT5 is not
available. The link you open specifies a
model that isn't available for your org.
>> Oh, okay. Okay. So, you're
>> you're going to have to uh
>> I think it might
>> you're gonna have to share your screen,
I think.
>> Yeah, might have to do that. Okay. Yeah,
cuz I I don't know if I'm going to have
permission
>> right off the bat for GPT.
>> Let me move all my goodies over to
another screen.
>> Exactly. Exactly. Um, ladies and
gentlemen, uh, uh, if you see Joseph
looking wildly around, it's because he's
got how many screens in front of you,
Joe?
>> I've got four screens. So, there's the
laptop screen, the TV above, and then I
got two over here to the right.
>> I guess it's your left, my right.
>> So, and and sometimes I wish I had more,
but I do what I can do.
>> Oh my god. Do you Are you uh you're a PC
guy though, right?
>> I am a PC guy. Yeah.
>> So, you uh uh so you have a bunch of um
uh different video cards and stuff
plugged into the back of your thing or
you using display port?
Uh, so it's actually like I've got my my
laptop and then my HDMI out. That's two
of the screens. And then the other two
actually are just driven off of USB,
believe it or not.
>> No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
>> Yeah. So, I've got like USB and then I
got like this little adapter. It splits
it out and it works pretty well. It
slows down a little bit here and there.
>> Yeah. Yeah. I hear you.
>> Take your time. Take your time. Get it
done.
>> Jump overmies
one. Okay, cool. Now, let me click to
share
>> and let me know if we're seeing that.
Okay.
>> All right. Let me add it to the stage.
And uh yes, it looks like it. Oh, you're
one of those people that likes to have
the blaring uh the blaring um not in
dark mode uh thing.
>> Oh, do you? Let's see if we
>> I don't care. I do not personally care.
It's just that as soon as it gets on
that white screen, you'll see that my
actual picture gets lighter because I'm
using my teleprompter right now.
And so, but that's okay.
>> It's good to go. I'm little. It doesn't
matter.
>> So, I mean, we have some neat things in
here that I've noticed. I mean, it looks
like we have this uh verbosity setting
that we can eventually play with a low,
medium, high. Not sure about that. I
don't see the like max tokens and stuff
like that available here, which is
>> uh I don't either, but I know for a fact
that it's uh got a context window of
over 400,000
tokens, y'all.
>> 400,000.
>> Yeah. Usually the output like right now
it's like max maximum output tokens. I
think the other ones we're using um the
input tokens it seems to be happy to let
you use as many as needed.
>> Like we have a couple of different
options. the usual suspects there. I
like how they call this developer
message now instead of the like the
system message, but I have a feeling
it's the same as before. And then I
think that you can type these in and
it'll like create the prompt for you,
>> which is which is kind of interesting.
So let's say uh let's say write a
premise for a different
novel concepts.
Let's see what it comes up with. I have
no idea what it's going to do there.
I'm definitely gonna have to move it to
this other screen. I need the uh real
estate to be able to see what you're
doing. There we go.
>> Yeah, some magic going on right now.
>> One thing I'm noticing is it's their
servers must be getting hit pretty hard
because the the stuff is a little slow.
>> Yeah, they were talking about how fast
it is and I'm like, huh? I have no I
have I'm pretty sure it's not going to
be like that today. I mean, you've got
seven they they just announced that they
have 700 uh 700 million people that are
now on uh on this. So, it's pretty
crazy. Okay, so it did it.
>> Okay, so let's see. Let's uh put a
prompt in. What's a good prompt? What's
a What type of uh novel premise do we
want to put uh Ch.
>> Okay. Well, uh, if I'm the one that's
doing actually, uh, um, let before we
All right, I just realized something. I
have not, uh, I have not done my, uh,
my, uh, my due diligence. Um, I have not
done my due diligence. Hold on, let me
just, Joseph, before we get into that,
um, Joseph,
>> yes,
>> tell me a little bit about yourself. how
in the world cuz nobody knows who you
are. They don't see you on any of these
things, any of that stuff. So, this is a
very exciting, momentous occasion having
you on here. So, I want to I want to
just talk to you for a couple of seconds
while you've now that you've gotten all
that set up.
Uh how in the world did you even uh are
you uh you were a writer, right?
>> No, no, no, no. Definitely not. In fact,
terrible at English. So, but I wanted to
become a writer. So, I'll give you a
little backstory of how I got to where I
joined the FFA, right? So, I started out
I've been in
>> IT now for the last 28 years. Um, I've
done a lot of different things. Um, the
bigger companies I've worked for, NBC
Universal and, uh, Disney's Internet
Group on their websites. Uh, actually
had a stint over in Kentucky for a while
and then back to California.
uh ended up working for some nonprofits
and then started a Salesforce
consultancy and that was going really
well. But then um joined uh FFA. So
originally that was I met Elizabeth over
uh while she was over at Pseudoite and
uh then she was telling me about how
she's going to start the FFA and I said
I want in but I don't want to pay for it
because I'm not really an author. I
can't really justify that, but I do want
to write a book and I think all this AI
stuff is going to be super helpful for
me. So, I went ahead and I said, "Okay,
um, I'll make tools for your members."
She said, "Great." She said, "Here, you
can have a free membership." That
eventually went from that to developing
tools, making some money off of each
tool to eventually becoming a partner
and just building tools all, you know,
full-time. And, you know, someday I'm
going to write a book.
>> Yes.
>> That was the whole point two years ago.
But
>> what's your what's your genre uh you uh
would like to write in?
>> So, well, I mean, I've been kicking
around some ideas. Um my latest one that
I've been looking at, I want to create
kind of like a kind of like a Black
Mirror style story u
kind of like a sci-fi uh story. A lot of
different ones about AI gone wrong. Um
the first story like I want is about
this lady who's in this uh ship and
they're traveling at a speed where you
know because of time dilation she's
going to age 20 years but everybody on
earth is 40 years. She leaves there's
some sort of catastrophic fertility
crisis down there. So now she needs to
be paired up with somebody on Earth. But
then that person starts out really young
because of time dilation and because of
the speech he can only communicate with
an AI avatar, not the actual person. And
then it turns out there's some stuff
going on on Earth that isn't quite
checking out. And uh you know, you get
your usual Black Mirror-ish style twist
going on. That's what I'm playing with.
>> I'm loving your imagination. Okay. So,
um that that was the the reason because
you were you went into this thing. Uh
you're like, "What would be a good
prompt?" I was like, "Oh, wait a minute.
I should talk about your background and
how you even got involved in this." So,
you have aspirations of being, you know,
of writing a book one day. Uh, and as we
get better and better at
>> at all of this stuff, we are and and the
technology keeps getting better and
better. Uh, when you finally make your
entrance in, it's going to be a pretty a
pretty prolificy sort of way to do it.
You will be able to sit down, use your
first draft. By the way, ladies and
gentlemen, make sure you go over to uh
click the links below and get the boot
camp and get your four credits and
you're going to be able to use your
first draft and you're going to be able
to like come up with your first chapter
and then really work on that first
chapter and then come up with your and
then come up with your whole book. And
that'll happen in a day. And then all
you're doing from that moment on is
editing your book, making sure it's
ready. And then you could possibly even
um publish it with the press, have
everybody work on your stuff for you so
that you don't have to like spend all of
your time or or you could publish it
yourself. So I I feel really excited for
your that part of your journey. I know
you've been so busy with all of the
stuff that we've been doing lately, but
the idea, you know, that you'll be
you'll have those resources and the
ability to really like make cool things
really really fast. I'm I'm excited for
you, man.
>> Yeah. I mean, we we embarked on the idea
of like you want to be quick to market.
So this idea of your, you know, generate
your premise, your outline, you you have
your worksheet, you fix all the major
points that you have, like you were
saying, we generate our first chapter,
get that styled out so it's writing the
way that you want it to write. So that
way when you develop subsequent
chapters, you're going to get that same
sort of style, and you also can see if
there's something wrong with like say
the perspect perspective or anything
like that. But then um what we're
finding is that a lot of people really
want to not necessarily do their first
chapter, click a button, and then have
their whole draft done. A lot of people
are wanting to be able to work in
smaller chunks. So originally, we wanted
it to just be, you know, super quick,
like, you know, get the you get the book
started, you go get a coffee, you come
back, you're ready to edit, right? Your
draft is done. Uh, but I think what
we're going to end up moving towards is
this idea that you can still do that if
you still want to do the first chapter,
run to market with that click, but you
can also um we're going to be
introducing the ability to do it in
smaller chunks. So, like you can do,
let's say, an act at a time, run the
act, go back, make your tweaks to the
act, get that fixed up the way you want,
do the next act, the next act, or you
could do it chapter by chapter. So we're
going to let people start running in
chunks.
>> So uh in this running in chunks does it
uh as you do your refining and stuff as
you go will it will those refinements
in turn uh reflect on the quality in
which you're getting the rest of the
chapters.
>> Yeah. So it'll affect everything. The
one thing we're still going to have to
figure out is um we've got it set up
where we've got like a like a worksheet
>> and then we've got um the different
chapters that go by and and that
impacts, you know, the work that you're
doing. And I think the last piece that
we really have to get in there to make
this work out well is make it so that we
can retrospectively update the worksheet
so that way it's reflecting some of the
changes that you're making if there's
anything material going on there.
Nice for Pancers.
>> Yeah. Yeah, for sure.
>> Yeah, man. Like they feel that it isn't
going exactly like they wanted to. And I
think that this whole I mean, come on,
Joseph.
This week has been crazy, right? So all
of this stuff is happening like as fast
as we uh I mean as fast as we can make
these tools the underlying uh
technologies that kind of push these
tools forward are getting so much
better. I mean theoretically
theoretically you could use one of uh
open I open AAI's open-source uh models
on your own phone. So, we could at not
that we will and uh I hope Elizabeth
isn't watching this so that she doesn't
she doesn't get this idea, but
um we could um make it so that you could
uh run maybe Raptorite or something with
a local uh local LM LLM because
Raptorite right now um runs on your
browser anyway.
>> Yeah.
>> Well, I mean the new OSS's Oh, sorry. I
didn't mean to interrupt. No, no, no.
You're not. You're not. This This is a
conversation, baby. You can go We can go
back.
>> So, so the OSS's that they released
right now, um, they're still a little
bit chunky. Like, so you have to have a
serious hardware to be able to run it.
I'm sure some people are going to take
it. And
>> what about the 20 bill?
>> Even the 20, I mean, eventually that
should be able to run on phones and
stuff. I mean, some people are doing it.
It's just not going quite as fast as
they want it to. I think we're going to
get some people making quantized
versions of these. Those will probably
be a little bit spiffier, but you know,
right now it's still going to be a
little bit slow. They're they're pretty
fun, though. Like I I love running them
on open router. Like they're pretty
powerful. When I was running it
>> initially, wait, no, I'm thinking
Horizon with GPT5. I was running GPD5
and I was really surprised that it was
giving me like the next steps of what I
should do in my book.
So whereas like sometimes you would get
a little tip here or there where they
would say, "Oh, okay. You know, should I
do this for you or that for you?" But
now it's like really seems to be dialed
in
>> to where I almost feel like
>> you could almost repeat it and say,
"Okay, do the next thing. Okay, do the
next thing until the book is done.
>> Doesn't quite work out that way. I
tried. Um it's a little short.
>> It goes a little short." Yeah.
>> But it but it is pretty interesting.
like it's they're really getting it
close to where it's almost like the easy
peasy book machine process is kind of
almost getting built into, you know,
like just your standard prompting. I
have this strange feeling that people
have been uh that people watch what we
do over here at the Future Fiction
Academy because often when they release
things even like uh this I watched the
whole presentation today and there was a
couple of moments I was like well did
they were they listening to us when we
said this one thing or that other thing?
I mean it it's supposed to be able to
help you a whole lot with your code.
It's supposed to be able to actually
write a lot better. uh GPT5. So, let me
see here. Let me I I think we have some
question. Do we have any questions? Uh
yes. Uh uh uh yes, that's how I like uh
that's people are saying people a lot of
people are agreeing with you. Oh, all
these people are here now. Wow,
everybody's here now. Um, uh, feels like
Here's McKinley saying, uh, uh, I feel
like every week is crazy.
>> Absolutely. Uh, can't even, uh, Kimberly
saying, "I can't even keep up. I had my
head in a project and now there's a
bunch of new stuff again."
>> Yeah, you can't be doing that. Can't be
looking away. It changes. Yeah, it
everything is uh and I I keep like I
said in uh the beginning, this is the
worst this is ever going to be. like
literally the worst it's ever going to
be, you know, and it's always going to
get increasingly better. And even if we
hit a AI winter again because scaling
doesn't seem to uh work uh because we
haven't been able to figure out how to
build a Dyson sphere or something
because of the energy requirements. Uh
even if that's the case, we still have
incredibly powerful tools. Okay. So, now
that we've had a little discussion about
Joseph and who he is and what he does
and how he does it and blah blah blah
blah blah, let's look let's look, ladies
and gentlemen, at uh at uh the
what the definitive the definitive model
that most people are going to be using
over the next year to a year and a half
before GPT6 eventually rolls out the
door, and that is GPT5. five. So, all
right, Joseph. So, type this in.
>> Um,
>> okay. You got
>> I'm ready. Uh let's go with um
h
uh
let's go with um
a young child develops uh
uh
super intelligence
at the age of six years old.
Before that, they seemed like a normal
person, but they went on a
walk in the woods with their mother and
a bright light shined on them. And from
that moment on,
they um
uh actually no uh uh she had super
intelligence.
Okay. And um and that's it. That's all.
>> All right. Well, let's just uh see what
happens then.
Okay, we'll see how good this prompt
was. I haven't even read through the
prompt that they created for us.
>> They created a
>> Yeah, I mean it seems like a new thing.
Like they're like trying to create more
prompts for people.
So, you have like
>> I'm very interested to see how this how
this uh rolls out now. Yeah. I I mean,
in theory, it's supposed to be really
fast, but I think it's getting hammered
so hard that it's
>> Oh, yeah. It's going to be like this for
a few days. I
>> think based on the pricing, it's like
really on par with 03.
So, kind of tells me
>> actually. Look how fast it's thinking.
Look how fast it's thinking right now,
though. I mean, wow.
>> Yeah. It's not that bad.
>> I'm consuming the light
stuff like that.
Now it's writing a little bit of
>> JSON reasoning.
>> That's kind of interesting.
>> That is interesting.
>> Oh, just outputed JSON which is
>> part of it too is because of the
examples here. So,
>> so it looked like their prompt they
wanted to output in JSON specifically.
So because those were the examples
there, that's why it gave us this as our
output, which is actually pretty useful
if you're developing software like like
we are for like your first draft or
something like that
>> because
>> but not necessarily for writing.
>> No. So I mean we could change that just
by uh just by switching out the
examples. Uh actually it it doesn't have
a clean uh deployment
meaning that it doesn't have any prompts
behind it and maybe you can make the
prompt yourself. I don't
>> what do you mean by that?
>> I mean that all that stuff over there on
the left hand side of the screen is
>> all stuff that they built in order to
work with developer message and all that
stuff.
>> Yeah. Um okay. So let's say let's out
output this in uh plain text.
We just want the premise.
>> Okay, I'll just update that.
>> Sometimes they overengineer it.
>> Oh, I Oh, that's good.
>> Okay, let's see. So, output form is
pretty good. Okay, so now it looks like
it's going to do it in markdown. That's
much better. Okay. All right. So, let's
just uh we can just clear this out.
>> Yeah, we'll just run it again. Okay,
let's do that.
This is very fascinating actually.
Hey, Joseph, do me a favor. Uh, lower
your camera so that your head room isn't
so head roomy. If you could Can you do
that?
>> So, like, uh,
>> yeah, just a little bit there.
>> I think try to
>> There we go. There we go.
>> There you go. Okay,
let's see what we come up with here.
You know, one thing that's interesting,
while we're waiting for that, I always
thought that so now they have these
template variables. I haven't tried them
yet, which kind of interesting. So, you
can you can just kind of go in there and
put in placeholders for different things
that you would want to put in your
>> What is the tool? What What tools would
you be would you be able to use?
>> Uh I I think if you put it in there,
there's uh probably a command in their
API that substitutes those variables.
I'm thinking
>> I don't know. I'd have to try it out and
see exactly the way because I know when
you look on the bottom here, there's
this like enter specific task use
template variables for dynamic inputs.
So
>> interesting.
>> Yeah. So I'm not exactly sure how you're
supposed to say the car is a Ford or,
you know, kind of how you're supposed
to. By the way, uh
>> uh I'm thinking if it's Black Mirror,
then it's like a government experiment
to see if they can like make people
super intelligent. So, they're flying
around and beaming people with a with
some kind of uh um interesting substrate
uh built in a lab crystal beam, you know
what I mean?
>> And yeah, but it's it's coming up with
its own stuff right now. Yeah, this is
kind of interesting, too. So, like, you
know, there there's always the names
have always been kind of an issue,
right, with
being kind of bland, but I noticed my
first couple of concepts I was doing
kind of off camera.
>> The first character
>> was coming back with a with a relatively
unique name. I thought, "Oh, wow." You
know, they they fixed their name issue,
but then every other name that came in
with it was, you know, was kind of back
to your usual suspects. Mhm. Mhm. I uh
I've been telling people I've got a new
technique for uh coming up with your own
names. Now, uh my new technique is to go
through my own um uh contact list that I
have on my computer that's that lives in
the cloud with Google and all of that
stuff. I I go through my own contact
list and I take the first name of one
person and then the last name of another
person and I combine them together and I
make all of my characters names like
that. now. Or you could uh use your
Facebook friends. You can go through all
of your Facebook friends. I've got I I
was in theaters, so I have like 500 uh
Facebook friends or something like that.
And I mean maybe more if I'm being quite
honest. Now that I am in the author
community, a lot of people have become
my friend, you know. So I can I use
everybody's names. I use all of um the
people I know's names. In this way, it
stays away from the uh Allaras of the
world and the uh the Chin Chin.
>> Yeah, the inevitable Dr. Chin.
>> Yeah. Yep. I think she has a place over
in Willowbrook if I'm not or Willow
Creek.
>> And uh at some point uh at some point
she will uh declare uh her uh declare
that uh all of this will um uh we're all
in this together. Yep. And uh I see I
see a question here from Chip. He's
asking if we've uh already tested the
OSS MOS. No, we haven't. We haven't
touched those yet. We actually
>> we actually have a I I actually am uh I
have a thing set up so that I can test
the uh test that right myself. Um where
is the
>> Oh, it's asking if I increase the size.
Like is it uh when you said increase the
size, is it too hard to read? Is that
what we're thinking or
>> Oh, yes. Yes. Um um I usually see and on
a Mac I would just double tap on either
my magic mouse or my uh uh trackpad that
I have to make
>> I can make it bigger there.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There we go. There we
go.
>> All right. Let's see what we got here.
So, we got some response. Six-year-old
Iris Beldon. Sounds somewhat unique,
actually.
>> Yeah. Yeah, it does.
>> Returns from a walk in the woods with
her mother clutching a pine cone and a
new bewildering gift. She can see the
hidden threads of patterns in everything
from the way ants move to the shape of
thunder. Huh.
>> Pull them taut to make the possible
ideas work. Overnight, she is
deciphering
dead languages, sketching machines that
don't exist and chalking hopscotch grids
that solve equations no adult can name.
terrified and fiercely protective, her
mother, Elena
got
>> tries to keep their uh keep their life
their quiet life intact even as Iris's
games draw the attention of a secret
government unit. A biotech company
hungry for a patient uh for patent on
genius and a fringe community convinced
the bright light in the trees was
heralded uh uh the herald of something
returning. As Iris builds towards
something only she understands. An open
door mapped in crayon across the walls
of their farmhouse. Elena discovers that
the light didn't merely bless her
daughter, it blessed her daughter.
>> It's interesting phrase.
>> I know. It's a lot of this is very
unique, right? And what it's coming up
with,
>> it shows a host of of an ancient
iterative uh uh it uh what is that?
Itinerate intelligence. Uh that
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah. itinerate. Wow. uh intelligence
that has crossed worlds by learning to
think through children. Each solution
Iris finds tightens the bond,
threatening to overwrite the parts of
her that laugh and love. With agent with
agents closing in and the device nearing
completion, Elena and Iris must decide
whether to help the visitor go home at
the risk of sh Oh, the visitors here.
>> Yeah, it's ET apparently.
>> Oh, yeah. uh uh at the risk of
shattering Iris's sense of self or sever
the connection and face the consequences
of orphaning a mind that might be the
only thing standing between humanity and
a greater unseen catastrophe.
Wow. This is this is Black Mirrorish, my
man.
>> Yeah, but this didn't even we didn't
even mention Black Mirror. No, the the
novel explores uh uh genius as a form of
childhood play, the ethics of becoming a
bridge between species, and how far a
parent will go to protect the person
their child is still becoming. Oh, you
hit good. Hit good. Hit good.
>> Hit good. So, what I noticed, so
apparently, so open routers confirmed
that the two horizon models, the alpha
and the beta, if anybody's been playing
with those on open router,
>> that those are confirmed. They're GPT5.
So,
I think what I noticed when I was
playing with uh Horizon, I think it was
alpha at the time, I was really stunned
with how well it controls the thread of
the story. like all of the bits of the
thread of the story will all weave
together really well. Whereas like with
other models, you know, before this, I
would find that, you know, sometimes,
you know, what you're talking about at
the beginning and at the end can
sometimes feel a little bit off or not
very well thought out. But in
>> Horizon, which I guess in GPT5,
uh you can throw stuff into it and it is
really amazing what it'll come with.
like let's make this tighter. What are
some ideas that we want to throw in to
make this more difficult for it to come
up with the premise? It's like so we can
say uh you know like uh make this darker
and more tragic,
right? And then um also add in some
uh physics, some real world
physics. Oops.
uh
to the story line and
let's make the visitor
like he's not there to leave. Let's make
the the visitor
uh interested in
capturing
the planet for itself.
Ah,
>> okay. I'm going to
>> Wait a minute. So, Open Router had the
uh had the Horizon model in here.
>> So, Open Router had Horizon Alpha and
then they came out with Horizon Beta a
couple of days ago.
>> Was it under Open AI's uh moniker or
>> No. So, they did it as a stealth model.
So, you didn't know who it was at the
time when they were dropping those
models. There was also another model
that came out a while back before those
two, which was awful. I don't know whose
model that is, but they should be
ashamed of themselves. But the open
router
open router the horizon models were
really good.
>> Interesting.
>> So, okay, let's uh let's just see. So,
see if see if we get the similar results
is what I felt like I got with what the
items are not persistent when store is
set to false. Please try again with
store set to true. Okay,
let's uh do that. But that seems a
little bit different from what we had to
do before. Okay, so let me copy that.
Get rid of that. What is the story set
to false true thing?
>> I don't know what the store logs thing
is needed. Well, let's try it again. It
It seems like a like just something
that's buggy.
So, I I think I needed to store the
memory. So, maybe it's oneshotting it.
Summary, verbosity, reasoning. Yeah, I
mean it to me it seems like it's buggy,
but
>> yeah,
>> let's let's do this.
We can
I can just add this on to the end of
this right now.
I'm gonna set up
>> I can just rerun it and then I have it
storing the logs. I don't know if that's
what's needed in order to
>> While you're doing that, I'm going to
set up my actually will it take over if
I say share? I guess it will.
Uh nope. I don't want to do that. I want
to do
>> That's okay for right now. It's just
going on in the background here.
>> I'm going to remove from the stage and
remove and put that back up. Okay, cool.
All right.
>> Colonizer objective. Sorry.
>> No, you're good. It's doing a whole
bunch of like thinking in the background
right now.
>> Okay. See here.
And uh see, make this darker. So, you're
you're uh make this darker. Also,
>> I I just want to point out I just saw a
blurb just flash by that I thought was
super interesting.
>> What
>> it was talking about how the lot it was
kind of hypothesizing
how the light that was seen in the
forest could have rewritten her brain
neurons.
>> Nice.
>> So, it was actually trying to come up
with like some sort of pseudocience to
to kind of describe what's really
happening. And that's what I saw as like
really the like huge difference. I mean,
well, there's other differences, but
that that was what really struck out to
me. It's like, wow, this is like really
well thought out. Let's see what we got
here at six years old.
>> Go ahead.
>> I was going to say, uh, why don't you
click on the thoughts for 40 seconds
thing?
>> Oh, okay. Just to see what we get here.
Okay, cool.
>> So, where was that thing that that I
saw? I wanted to stick to realistic
physics here, focusing concepts like the
brain's metabolic constraints. Heat
dissipation, right? I'm sure we all
think about heat dissipation.
>> Wow.
>> Ideas. Ideas like reversible computing
to avoid overheating. She finds herself
increasingly isolated. Where's the quote
graph tragedy of physics orbital
mechanics? The bright light represents
the aliens influence which has seated
colonization algorithm in her brain
pushing her to alter Earth's environment
for the aliens benefit.
Uh just thinking
>> Chip, we have not we have not uh messed
with the open source models yet. We're
just fussing with GPT5 because literally
an hour ago.
>> Yeah. Look at look at this. Look at
this. The bright light could represent a
von Newman probe administering
nanotechnology that rewrites her brain's
ion channels.
>> Wow. Oh,
>> so like brilliant.
>> This is crazy thinking, right? Like
that's pretty detailed. Like that's the
kind of stuff I love. So, okay, let's
see what it came up with the second
time. At 6 years old, Sylvia walks out
of the pine dark woods with her mother
and a new geometry inside her skull.
Overnight, she intuitits orbital
mechanics from the way crows wheel in
thermals. Okay, that's a little too
complex. By the end of the week, she is
correcting her teacher's calculus and
deriving Maxwell's equations and crayon.
The genius is not inspiration, but
engineering. A colonizing probe is
rewritten. Her neural architecture
toward near reversible
>> computation, pushing her brain close to
lers limits. I love how it's like it's
like pulling out like real theories
>> so she can think at superhuman speeds
without cooking herself. The light in
the tree. See, isn't that crazy? It's
like actually thinking through like
>> that's the part where we just read,
right? It made it
>> it had to like account for the fact that
if your brain had too many neurons going
at once that it would literally create
some measurable form of heat and it had
to have crazy
>> I'm going to have to reiterate what
Kimberly said because I just put it up
on the screen before. Holy moly.
>> Yeah.
>> Holy moly. So that's what I think like
for for brainstorming and for premises
and for being able to make sure that
everything in your story like has
>> like connections that make sense. I mean
this is super interest especially for
like pseudocience sort of stuff is so
interesting.
>> Yes, let's be real. Uh science fiction
speculative
>> uh specula uh speculative fiction
imagine. All right. So, uh I'm thinking
that uh there's a possibility that if
you are coming up with a whole a whole
world that it would really think about
the intricacies and the the consequences
of a universe built around these types
of rules. and you will have a much more
solid base to um lore to the history of
the world, all of that stuff. And it'll
all be like really actionable sort of
wow.
>> Look at this. Invader is patient and
realistic. Faster than light travel is a
fantasy. So conquest is done with
physics and time.
>> Wow.
See, I like that. That's not He's not
going to just like take a side step and
just s sideestep light. So, it's like
must have been there for
>> But I bet I bet if you um
if you uh gave it um you you said to it,
well, um faster than light uh travel is
a fantasy, but what maybe we want to
have happen is the ability to uh
eventually go faster than light. and
these uh and the honing of these brains,
you know, you could say anything. You
could literally say anything and it
would
>> Yeah. But because I tried to ask about
the physics, it's like, okay, they want
to ground this in realistic physics. So
then it kind of pushed the story in that
direction,
>> but but it's grounding it. I love how
it's grounding it.
>> Kimberly, I had not even really thought
about this. That sounds like the movie
phenomenon, you know, with uh John
Travolta and at the end he dies. Well,
sorry spoilers.
I mean, the the movie came out in the
mid in the in the mid odds, so um but um
yes, it is very much like the Oh, wow.
But it had no aliens in it. Um he he man
he had a tumor uh in his head that
created the ability. Um is that the
cloud mode for Olama? What is uh what
does that mean?
the cloud.
>> Um, I don't know if they're out like
this.
>> Wait a minute. I wait a minute. It says
turbo mode is insanely fast. I was able
to test 120B. The research is uh not as
good though. Uh, the research is not as
good though. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um,
get into Yeah, I'm just making sure I I
caught all of this. I mean, people are
pinging off like I don't know what right
now. Um, but yes, uh, this is actually
very interesting. All right. So, now we
know, y'all. Let's uh let's uh let's be
real about it. Now we know. Joseph, move
your camera to the left just a little
bit so that you're in the center of the
I'm a little OCD about that. There we
go. All right. Yeah. Yeah. You're
looking good, baby. You're looking good.
You got you you you don't I love the way
you fixed everything.
>> I'm like there. I'm like I'm on camera,
man. I'm on camera. This is what you got
to do. I get you. Uh but um now
everyone, let's uh let's play around
uh before we're going
other media. Okay, remove
uh let's play around inside of plot
drive. What we're going to do here is um
I'm working on um something for the FFP.
Okay. And uh I'm going to actually copy
this so that I don't ruin it. Duplicate.
Call it a copy.
Okay.
>> Do we have access to GPT5 and plot drive
now?
>> No, there's no way.
>> That's possible.
>> No, there's no way.
>> Well, especially if the open router
might have it.
>> Oh, open router might have it, but they
don't
>> because because the APIs are there
depending on the tier. So that they
could have released it, but if not,
>> it's just Yeah, it's not in here. And
>> what about the open router list?
>> I will I will look right now.
>> Excited.
>> Open router. Open AI. Where are you?
Open.
Open AI.
405.
Boom. There we go.
>> Everybody, it's available.
>> Oh, wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Okay, so before
we get with that, before we get with
that, because we were we were gonna go
and do some opensource work here.
>> The cool thing about the OSS, man, is
that stuff's so fast, man.
>> Yes, I am very excited. And uh it
thinks, doesn't it?
>> It a little bit. And it and it's it
feels pretty good. Like what you're
getting out of it doesn't see doesn't
feel bad. I think OpenAI strategy is
they're they're trying to kind of
suffocate I think a lot of the other
people in the marketplace by releasing
this OSS model that's pretty darn good.
>> Let's go with that one. Let's go with
the 120. And uh I'm going to
let's see here. Um
let's see. Let's go
uh moment of human beings between
distant points of space. Uh, the world
exploded with Okay. So, we're going to
take this right here
and then we're going to fix it.
Um, and we're going to fix it by saying
the flooding gravitational forces. Um
uh make
let's see
make this incredibly
visceral and in your face and it needs
to scare the reader.
Okay. And
>> and which mall are we at? Which OSS are
you? The
>> uh 120
>> or the 120? 120. Okay, cool.
>> 120. I didn't want to screw around with
the little teeny one just yet because
you never know, right?
>> And one's not bad.
>> I feel you. I believe you. Um,
>> it's just the speed of it is just so
ridiculously fast. It's pretty awesome.
>> Now, I'm going to submit. And from the
moment I click, let me see. Can I change
my watch to the Yes. I want to be able
to see the seconds here. All right. And
submit.
Bam. That was 3 seconds. That's really
fast, actually.
>> The the universe ruptured in a blinding
searing flash. White hot plasma hammered
his eyes until they burned. a crushing
inverted gravity. Um uh a crushing
inverted gravity ripped his stomach
clean out and he was ripped into
nameless uh screaming voids that clawed
at his soul. time warped, stretching
like moltant taffy, then snapped back in
a brutal bone shattering jolt that
slammed his brain against the against
his skull, leaving his thoughts a
deafening um leaving his thoughts a
deafening course of screaming static.
>> Yeah. And I feel like, you know, you're
looking at I'm looking at that and I'm
saying to myself, that is pretty darn
good for an open source.
>> Yes.
>> Or open weights model and and the
pricing on that. Let me see. I got to
look at the pricing.
>> It's dirt. It's dirt cheap.
>> Blows my mind.
>> So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to
I kept both of them.
>> I want you to rerun that though with the
20.
>> I am. I'm going to put that in there.
And I'm going to say
uh I'm going to put uh parentheses
12B.
>> Yep.
>> And then
>> cuz this thing is 9 cents what you just
did. That's 9 cents per million input
tokens.
>> So that's that didn't even that didn't
even cost me nine. That cost me uh 00001
or something like that of it.
>> It'd be lower than that, man. It's It's
crazy. And then
>> Okay, let me change this actually to
[Music]
uh scrolling.
[Music]
Where is it? OSS.
There we go. 20. This one's free. the
free one.
>> Holy crap, it's free.
>> Well, they have a free the It's not
going to be forever, but yeah, they have
the the free version. Otherwise, you're
paying 4 cents per million in and 16
cents per million out.
>> All right, we're going to do
>> Yeah, we're going to do the exact same
prompt. Okay,
>> see what we get.
>> This is taking a half of a second. Yeah.
I mean, it might be that people are
hammering the free one more, but like
once you got your your turn, it went
fast.
>> Okay, so uh let's see here. Uh
the universe detonated around him into a
white hot uh a white hot rolling
inferno. Raw photons shredded his
retinas until they burned like molten
glass. gravitational forces, merciless
and visceral, crunched his gut until it
felt uh till it felt bone and tendon
being uh until his uh his gut until it
felt bone and tendon. Yeah. Wait a
minute. That's weird. Hushed his gut
until it felt like bone and tendon being
torn apart. That's what it should say,
right?
I mean, that feels weird the way that's
phrased. Maybe I'm just being wrong
about that. Uh crunched his gut until it
felt and uh it felt bone and tenant
being torn apart and the world that had
existed crumbled into unseen nameless
dimensions that hummed with ozone and
burnt metal. Time stretched like a
rubber band, pulsed, then snapped back
in focus with a bone shattering bang
that slammed his consciousness into the
hard shell of his skull. Oh my god.
>> Uh I don't know what Oh my goodness.
>> Not as good as the other, but you know,
>> but it does the job. Then you can
>> four four cents per million input tokens
and 16 cents per million output tokens.
It's not bad, right?
>> Oh my gosh. But but what's amazing about
this is like if you decided I don't know
um like if you can take a just like take
one of your chapters and just say you
want it to be like summarized, you know,
with the OSS, it would probably do it in
like the same amount of time it took you
to get this one paragraph would probably
be the equivalent of what it would take
you to get the the whole summary of the
document produced. It It's so fast once
it's running.
>> Wow. This is very impressive.
>> And theoretically, all this could run
locally. Like you could literally in
theory you have the beefy beefiest uh a
beefy enough machine, right? Like you
could be running this internet's off and
you could still be going with this.
>> Wow. That you could uh you could be on a
boat.
>> Yeah. Oh, you know boat. You got
internet these days. I mean, that's
where that's where I was when I was
testing the stuff out. But
>> yeah, but you don't need a you don't
need I mean, you could be on you could
be on a boat and not have the internet
and just be sitting and still writing
and still writing.
>> That right there is impressive.
>> All right, let me uh check back with the
folks. What are y'all thinking of this?
Um
uh
it doesn't show up in re uh refresh. Uh
wait a minute. Okay. So plume uh
plumestone uh after you refresh it. If
you have an open a open router key then
you have to like really look through the
open AI uh things because it kind of
fades into the because it's got it's the
OSS starts with an O and it's probably
tricking your brain. So, go back
cuz I I had a hard time finding it
myself. So, uh go back in there. Uh
uh uh let's see. No wonder they're
getting pounded for real. For real. Um
Olama. I'm sure they're dropping people
are dropping it into Lama and stuff like
that. Uh I agree. The speed is
ridiculously fast. I'm getting woes. Uh,
I feel uh I feel like K new Ree. Whoa,
whoa, whoa.
Hey yo yo, what's up, Danny? And uh,
yep. I'm excited for the new NPU chips.
Uh, so we don't need to buy super
expensive GPUs. Uh, well, the cool thing
about being on a Mac is that like half
of that freaking chip is an MPU chip.
So, um I'm really excited about because
it already has a bunch of neural uh um
settings built into the chip and that's
why I love my M M4 Mac Mini because I
pro like if you got a maxed out M4 Mac
Mini, you could probably run this thing
really really efficiently or even buy
like a a Mac Studio or something like
that. Um let's see. Let's see. Uh, looks
like peeps are working on local versions
as well on hugging face. They're still
pretty uh they're still pretty big
though. Yeah, they really are. Curious
how it uh how it does on a full chapter
dialogue and matching style um and tone
with other chapters.
>> And is that question OSS or is that
question for GPT5?
>> I don't know. Um, Chip, uh, clarify
please. And check out, let's see here.
Check out what David Au is doing. Uh,
oh, uh, on on Hugging Face, right?
Gotcha. Um, y'all should, if you're that
nerdy, that techy, go over to, uh,
Hugging Face, y'all. Uh, and check that
out for real. Um, man, this is All
right, so now let me do this. Let me do
this, Joseph. All right, I'm gonna go
back.
blah blah. There we go. And uh we're
going to switch this over.
>> Yeah. Let's try with nano. Like do you
want to do you want to see what the nano
GPT5 does?
>> Does it I don't know if it if they give
us access to the nano. I know they
>> if you had access to the other GPT5. I
bet you're gonna have you're gonna have
>> chat. What does that mean?
>> Yeah. No, see that's very interesting.
So when I was on um open router the GPT5
it would not let you use unless you
brought your own key but the GPT5 chat
you can use I do not know there I mean
one must be postrained on chat and the
other one isn't I'm not sure. All right.
So, let's go nano
and then we will we will run the same
uh prompt again.
Nano
and
okay,
we're at
>> that's got to be the closest GPT5 has to
their OSS. So, let's see. The other
thing about OSS is they don't the the
data on them is not as good as GPT5.
Like they were still using I think the
older data sets. So, I think they it
goes into
uh 2024 at some point.
>> It didn't work. Okay, let's try it
again.
>> What? Wait, it didn't
>> didn't give me a result.
>> Nope. Oh, I have a pending response.
What is that about?
>> Oh, I have to up thumbs up or thumbs
down something.
>> No, it disappeared. It was some kind of
glitch with plot drive. Let me see if I
can refresh. There it is.
Uh
oh. And it put it at the top.
>> That's a glitch.
That is a glitch.
>> Give it a thumbs up or down.
>> Um it Wow. Wait a minute. If I give it a
thumbs up, will it erase the the world
exploded?
Is it just going to leave it there?
Yeah, that's weird. Now, it did it erase
the world just Nope. Nope. That was
definitely a plot drive thing, not some
kind of weird bug because of the new
thing. So, I'm going to cut it
and
I'm going to go down here. This is why I
highlighted those things so I could find
it really easy.
Um,
oh wow, this is it's acting weird.
So
>> anyway,
paste that. Give it a little highlight
and an italic.
And then
put in there that this is uh
um GPT5
Nano.
>> Oh, that was the nano one. So that's the
nano one that came. Oh, okay.
>> Yeah, it did a weirdness. Um, anyway,
let's uh let's see what it has to say.
There we go. The world detonated in a
white hot f uh detonated in a white hot
furnace of chaos. Pure energy flooding
his retinas. A searing metal rasped
brightness that burned through his
sight. Gravity slammed into him, turning
his stomach inside out as he plummeted
through dimensions that scream names
that didn't exist. No. Time stretched
like viscous taffy, then snapped back
with a brutal jawsplitting yank that
hammered his brain against his skull.
Nice.
Nice. I'm not mad at that. I mean I can
do something with interesting I
>> and that so that's technically cheaper
than the OSS120B
>> what
>> so in theory nano might be smaller than
that because the cost to host that and
that the nano of course has a 400k
context versus the OSS120 which has 131.
All right, let's uh let's keep going
up the open AI. Man, they got a lot of
models. Um, so that was now now let's do
many
>> and uh
let's see here.
[Music]
>> Let's do many. And then we will
highlight this
and Oh, I didn't mean to do that. Um,
let's zoom out. Fix.
Oh, I lost my
shoot.
Um, exactly.
>> Do do something close to it. It's fine.
>> Yeah, it doesn't have to be a precise
test.
>> Yeah, but yeah, I'm a scientist.
[Music]
Wow.
>> Well, when I'm trying to do these
things, it's always better if it's
completely rec uh um
uh repeatable. You know what I mean? All
right.
Um,
make this more visceral and full of
description
while also
making it
incredibly scary for the reader.
That'll do.
Wow, that was fast.
Did you notice that?
>> Yeah. I mean, that's probably more
likely the closer to the real speed,
right, that we're going to get in a
couple of days when things calm down.
>> Yeah, because I bet a bunch of people
are not messing around with many um as
they are with five and stuff like that.
And it's working through open router, so
there's a a little like loop around and
all that stuff. So, I'm keeping both.
And uh you notice something right off
the bat, Joseph?
>> What would that be? Is it
>> It's a lot longer.
>> Yeah.
>> Like I haven't even read it. Haven't
even read it yet. And it's a lot longer.
Um let me see here. We'll go this. We
will put in exactly what it was. Um GT
five mini
and
put a big T there. So that that T that
got cut off. Okay. Now
uh let's
There we go. The world detonated into
searing white chaos. all uh an
allconsuming light that shoved through
his eyes like molten metal and made the
lids made the lids crack against his
skull. Gravity folded and snapped in on
itself. His stomach lurched as if
dropped down a well of teeth.
Organs sloshing against bone. sound
collapsed into a single high-pitched
keening that filled his head, then
fractured into a dozen jagged echoes
that hammered his bones. He tasted ozone
and hot copper, his tongue thick and
foreign in his mouth. Space stretched
and recoiled in nauseating elastic
gulps, angles and distance warping until
the submarine felt like a coffin and a
uh uh until the felt like uh both a
coffin and a cradle surfaces lost his
edge and reappeared as smeared uh
phosphorescent trails. Every nerve
screamed cold heat, pressure, sharp
electric hisses against skin uh beneath
skin until his senses were a raw exposed
nerve ending.
And the only thing left was the raw
animal terror of not having anywhere to
land.
That's pretty good now.
>> Yeah.
Let's try this one more time.
Holy crap. That was actually
>> might have two more times, right?
Because you got a chat GBT and chat GBT
chat.
>> The five and the five chat. So
>> yeah, that's weird by the way. I mean
>> I think it is weird too. Yeah.
>> I'm just like really. But look look how
look how look at that. It's so nice. 3.5
uh 4
4.1
4 I have no idea what the 40 thing was
about, but hey, whatever. And then five.
Oh, it's so nice. It's so nice when they
like do things the right way. Uh I'm
going to The last one's going to be uh
GPT5. So, we're going to go with chat
and highlight
fix it
and
submit.
Woo! Jeez.
>> Yeah, their servers are starting to
recover.
>> Well, do you know what's interesting
about this one though, Joe? Notice
anything?
>> You going to say that it's longer?
>> It it it is longer, but guess what else
it did? gave me a little bit of blurbby
thing in the beginning and a little bit
of blurbby thing at the end.
>> That's probably part of the chat
training.
>> Oh, see. Yeah.
>> So, just re just rerun it. Just like
>> No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm just
going to cut it.
>> Just need to keep it. Okay.
>> Nah, I'm just going to keep it and then
I'm going to cut this part out.
>> Well, no. I say you should keep that
just to know what what it says. Oh,
>> and then we we should just rerun it one
more time with just the five by itself
and just see what it looks like if it
has any blurry blurbs or if it's
blurbless.
>> Oh my god. Still has that message for
GPD5.
>> It probably won't, but
>> they're still saying that they have the
they require you to bring your own key
for that one.
for the GPT5, not for the chat, but for
the the five by itself, it seems like
you have to have it set up. So, I don't
know if it cause a problem or not
through plot drive. Guess we'll
>> we will we will see. And italics
and there we go. And then I will put
um
GPT
five chat
Anding.
All right. And this was its response.
Understood. You want me to keep the
meaning. Let me just zoom this in
because let's be real,
it's hard to see. There we go. Uh,
understood. You want me to keep the
meaning and sequence intact, but enhance
it according to your request. Make the
moment more visceral, full of
description, and genuinely terrifying
for the reader. without freelancing
beyond that scope. Did I say that? I
don't remember saying that.
>> Mine.
>> I know. Here is your requested rewrite
of that specific passage.
Then it's pretty long right here. All
right. The world detonated in a white
hot uh white hot ruin light so
blistering it felt like acid pouring
directly into his eyes, searing down the
optic nerves until his skull throbbed
with molten brightness. A bone deep
vibration shuddered through the hull and
into his marrow as if the universe
itself had gripped him and was shaking
him apart molecule by molecule.
Gravity didn't just shift. It wrenched
at his insides, twisting stomach and
intestines into knots before uh before
yanking them in opposite directions. An
obscure tugofwar between realities. He
was failing. Uh he was falling but not
down. It was a plummet through the
direction that had no names. Shaped that
only uh shapes that only existed for the
fraction of a second it took for them uh
to
wraing
for it took them for wrathfully.
>> Yeah.
>> Wrathfully collapse.
>> Wow. That's a hard That's a hard phrase
to say as a narration. Uh them to
wrathfully
collapse in on themselves. His own
heartbeat pounded in athmic spurts
seeming to come from somewhere inside
his body. Of course it was somewhere
inside of his body. If you say it was
his heartbeat, every nerve screamed high
voltage panic. His jaw locked as if to
keep his teeth from rattling free. time
elongated into a thin quivering
filament, then compressed without
warning, crushing the breath from his
lungs before it all snapped back with a
brutality of s of uh snapped cable,
whipping his consciousness into place so
violently his brain felt like it had
ricocheted off of the inside of his
skull. This keeps the original in uh
events and sequence intact but heightens
physical detail, sensory overload and
dread to make the reader feel like the
moment uh feel the moment as terrifying
and overwhelming.
Uh, do you want me to uh do matching
treatment for the moment immediately
after he materializes in San Francisco
Bay so that the fear carries through the
transition? That would make the terror
bleed directly into the next beat.
Yeah, that's that's kind of the cool
stuff I see a lot more with the GPT5
that I didn't see as much in the other
models. Sometimes with the coding ones,
it would ask you in somewhat of a
similar way.
>> Uhhuh. But that's
>> interesting.
>> But they trained it like
to uh to do that. They're new. They have
some sort of I think they called it
their was it the Horizon or Harmony? I
think it was Harmony.
>> Horizon. I think it was Horizon.
>> Well, no, Horizon was the name of the
model. Oh, okay.
>> Spell model, but I think they have like
their I think they have their format the
output format that you get you get like
tables and some of that other stuff. I
think I think they call it the harmony
format. That's how they like they train
the output to be for the open AI models
difference. Yeah,
>> there it is.
>> Yep,
>> there it is.
>> Yeah, that's just an open router
limitation. So, for some reason the the
GPT5 without the chat,
>> they're not offering that directly. I
don't know if people are probably using
that's the one that people probably want
to use to code. So, that one probably
gets hammered. I don't know.
>> Hammered. Uh, let me do this while I'm
thinking about it. Uh,
>> what we could do, I mean,
>> I'm gonna take I'm gonna copy that
and then I'm gonna ch and then I'm going
to refresh.
Um,
because I want
to see if they've done the update yet.
Actually, uhoh, I realized something. I
haven't made it available to that API
and I don't know if I can.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, maybe that might be it
right there. All right. So, I'm in my
own API
right here.
Uh, I should I go to
>> No, just go just click on create like so
go back and then you can just click the
create button and I think the create a
champ prompt will just create what
you're used to seeing as
there. So now let's see if your five is
there. Is there no five?
>> No five.
>> Huh?
>> No five.
>> Maybe that's the API key that you have.
>> Right. Right. I wonder if creating a new
one, you might be able to get one that
has five.
>> Okay, I'm going to
I'm going to stop sharing for a second.
Create a new secret key. Call it uh
uh
uh we'll call it uh GPT
5 key.
And then I'm going to put it
I guess I'll put it in this one. Create
the key. And I'm going to copy that key.
And now I'm going to close this down.
GPT5.
I'm going to really quick I'm going to
put this in my keys.
Um,
hold on just a second y'all.
>> I feel so cheated. I'm looking at this
right now. They have uh Open AI has an
announcement introducing GPT5.
You go to the screen. It has like a try
G chat GPT. You click on that button
>> and then it takes you to a screen where
you don't get to try chat GPT5. It's
just the same old ones as it was before.
open
in here.
>> Yeah, I they It's because they're still
rolling it out. And let's be real,
everybody wants it right now
>> for sure
>> because every because people want to
either prove or disprove
that it's the best or the or a step in
the right, you know, they there's a lot
of haters and non-haters out there. All
right. So, now that I've got that
copied,
>> yeah, other things are really
interesting about the chat GPT5
announcements, the voice sounded pretty
impressive. In fact, it sounds like you
can actually tailor the voices now like
you could with some of those other like
Hume AI and some of those other voice
ones where you can kind of tell it the
type of voice you want.
>> So, I wonder if we get that to actually,
you know, read stuff in a way that we
could record it. Like I wonder if we
could tell it like, "Hey, read this
passage." And then you paste the passage
and then you have it read it. And I
wonder if you could make it like
recorded as an MP3 somehow. That would
be kind of awesome. Platform. How do I
Let me just make sure I don't have
anything exposed here before I let you
see what's happening.
Show you what this request. Okay, cool.
Um All right. Now I'm going to
have to find There we go. Uh, it's
teasing you, Joseph. It's teasing you.
>> That's what she says.
>> Yeah, Reginal, I agree. I'm I'm with you
on that. Uh, wow. I love this. Seems a
bit overkill. Uh, yeah, it does. Okay.
Uh
um share
>> also up really quick if if anybody's
using cursor like it was uh they made
that announcement about their deal with
cursor and it was definitely there like
pretty much right away after they said
that.
>> Hell yeah. Because they had the cursor
dudes on the live stream. Boo. You know
they were going to do that right. But
you know they were going to treat them
right. Um let's see here. There we go.
Let's go there. All right. So, when I
look in here, how do I change the
models? I can't remember where I go. Do
I go
>> to to get into the the playground?
>> No. No. To uh uh add the models to the
API that I have right here.
>> Oh, I think if you just like you when
you create the API, you can select
whether it's um whether it just has all
permissions.
So, can can you see the API? We can take
a look. I think we can see whether or
not the API has any restrictions on it.
>> API
where down here
>> uh you might be
click on the cog in the top right
corner.
>> I am on a okay cog
>> the API keys.
>> All righty. I think it's towards
All right. Just click on the edit button
next to the key on the right side and
just see.
>> Uh, you know, I'm worried that I will be
>> You won't It won't It won't show your
key. You can't even see You can't even
see the key yourself anymore if you
wanted to.
>> No, I have all the permissions on.
>> It has all the permissions there. Okay.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But there's a there's
a list where you can add and take things
off of the API.
>> Well, I think as soon as you have all
permissions, that's a list.
>> Limits. There it is. I found it. It's
limits.
And then edit. It's like the things that
is available there. Yeah, it's uh
let's see
that is
five mini GPT5 mini.
Let's see
what other one
GPT5. There it is. And
uh GPT5.
Wow, they do not GPT5
chat latest.
Um, uh, let me share my screen so that
everybody sees what's happening here.
Uh, there we go. And share
um,
share limits. There we go. Just wanted
to make sure. All right. So, this is
what I did. I clicked down here under
project and hit limits right over here
everybody. I hit limits and then that
gives you a list and then you click into
the list to edit it. And what I'm doing
right now is clicking in is uh editing
this list. So I've got
five four
three four.
Um just making sure I'm not missing any
of them like this one right here.
They're not next to each other. Joe,
there's mini. There it is. Mini. GPT5.
Mini.
Uh GPT5. GPT5 as of 87.
So, um, but isn't that something? Look
at this stupidness.
Look at the way they got this laid out.
Ain't this dumb? And then save.
Now I should
be able to I'm going to stop sharing
here and I'm go over to plot drive
because I'm paranoid y'all. I just don't
want y'all seeing my stuff. I'm sorry.
And I know that it's probably not that
big a deal, but let's see here. Um
config.
No, no, no. Uh huh. There. Maybe here.
Uh,
oh hell. Where do I put my API keys
inside of plot drive? Did they change
that? They sure as crap did and I didn't
realize it.
Where are my API keys
inside of plot drive?
Uh oh, there we go. No, no buttons.
Um,
[Music]
text alignment.
Huh?
Uh oh, there we go. Dear God, it's in
the thing. It's just Okay. Open AI
trash.
And then
there we go.
And
now I should have access
I should have access to open AIS
now. There we go. And let's share again.
And uh
right there and
plot drive. And
all right now I should have five in
there somewhere. There they are.
Joseph, we are cooking with gasoline.
We are
cooking with gasoline. Now I can do
that. Run that same one. The same exact
one with uh
Oh, did I?
Yes, I did. I lost I bet I lost that.
Okay, that doesn't matter. We're just
going to fix it.
Oh, AI buttons.
Fix it. And uh
make this incredibly visceral. And I
want the reader to feel the terror of
the moment.
There we go. And uh Oh, look at that.
Can you change that right there? Oh,
Joseph, that's a that's such a quality
of life thing they did. That's pretty
good.
We're going to keep it at that and then
hit submit.
And let's see how fast their own servers
What unsupported max tokens is not
supported. Ah,
let's go down then. If you're really
getting all personnikity with me. What's
that about? What is that about?
That's weird.
>> Talking with my mic. Um, do you have the
ability to um set any of the parameters
or No.
>> Uh, what do you mean? like uh
>> like I wonder if we can because the
problem is it's it's sending a parameter
that the the endpoint doesn't support
for five. So that's going to be the
error.
>> Yeah, I think it's this. I think I had
it up on 32 and it doesn't do 32. Even
though that would be weird.
>> No, it's it's the name it's using. It
doesn't like the name.
>> What do you mean? Well, there's like
there's like max output tokens, max
tokens. There's a bunch of different um
see what is it saying right there. See,
it says unsupported parameter max token.
So, I think it has to be it wants you to
use max completion tokens. That's
something that they have to do behind
the scenes.
>> So, we can't use it.
>> So, I think yeah, until they they update
it, you can't use it. The good thing
about like open router I think it was it
was kind of like autodeprecating the
request so that way you didn't uh
it didn't pass that that one that was
causing the error but for the direct
requests probably have to wait for them
to patch that.
>> Yeah. I wonder
will it do uh will it do that same thing
with uh the other GPTs? I have a feeling
for the fives it probably will.
>> Okay,
let's just try Let's just try that one.
Not that it's going to work.
[Music]
>> Oh, well,
>> that worked.
>> Yep. It's just for five.
>> It's just for five by itself. has its
own. That's interesting.
>> Isn't that
>> wonder if it's also broken in YFD? I
have to check. I did some testing on
like the basic, you know, like nano and
stuff just to see if that was working,
which it was. So,
>> yeah, we will definitely because right
now we can't run anything or we can't
run it.
>> Yeah. Not unless we're at the
playground, I guess.
>> Not unless you're in the playground.
>> Which is fine. Which is fine. Well, we
are we are an hour and a half into this
uh um epicness, everybody. And uh I
wanted to uh you know uh let let me go
here.
Um let's put it back on the two of us.
Joseph,
uh what are your thoughts right now? Um,
what do you what do you what's your
impression of the the model and how it's
doing its thing, my man?
>> Yeah, I mean it looks good. I mean, like
for writing, it seems really cool. I'm
pretty happy about that from everything
I'm seeing. Coding, I played around with
it a little bit. I haven't been super
impressed with it compared to um, you
know, just using regular Sonnet. So,
I'll see how how that goes. It's
supposed to be a lot better based on
those charts. So, we'll see how it works
in the real world.
>> Is it syntax? Uh, you think it's some
type of syntax problem?
>> Uh, or do you think it's just not as
good as haunted yet?
>> No, I mean, it's it's probably pretty
good. It's definitely really good if
you're doing like your one shot, right?
Like, so if you're running it and you're
just literally creating something from
scratch, I think it's going to do really
good. But then if you're throwing
something in that has completely
different patterns than what it's used
to using,
>> then it might be that it also might just
be cursor. This might be a recent thing
that happened. So cursor might not be
kind of optimized to, you know, work
well with OpenAI's newest model yet. It
could be that too because they do kind
of tweak their language on the back end
to try to make the calls more efficient.
So,
>> do you watch uh Theo Theo's channel?
>> Uh, not really. No. Has he
>> You know who I'm talking about, though,
right?
>> Yeah, I've seen I've seen Theo. Yeah.
>> Yeah. So, uh, he was talking about, um,
it having some type of weird,
uh, not syntax, but, um, that it like
the the open- source ones just they
would they would output like they love
charts and stuff like that. He would ask
it a simple thing and it would almost
always give him a chart for some weird
reason, you know, a table. I mean, a
table for some weird reason. I'm
thinking
that these have been honed to do
specific
things and that the that it's supposed
to work well inside of things like
cursor when you're doing going line by
line and stuff like that. So, uh, even
the one So, it would do a oneshot,
right? But it probably it probably also
does, uh, has something inside of the
backend that is supposed to help it
specifically with these other coders.
What are you using? Cursor.
>> Yeah. So, I'm using cursor and cloud
code. So, the the one
>> It's not going to work in cloud code.
Well, believe it or not, I think Cloud
Code actually will work with OpenAI
compatible models.
>> Uh, you didn't hear today, but they uh
>> they cut off Open AI
uh a Open AI's API access. This is a
full Cold War, baby.
>> I know.
>> Yeah, they're they're in a tough
position.
>> Who? Who? Claude.
>> Yeah, like Anthropic in a tough
position. I mean, they they've got
everything banked on coding, right? And
if they lose a good chunk of their
coding, you know, they kind of got
nothing else to stand on.
>> Yeah.
>> Look at Look at how good OSS is. Look at
how good OSS is. Dirt cheap.
>> Amazon needs to buy them or or they
should get bought by uh Apple. Apple's
got enough money. They should buy
Anthropic. They just should. It would be
I mean to to acquire that big of a team
and with uh uh their commitment to
privacy and stuff like that. Uh Amade
and him would pro Amade and uh um uh
Cook would probably get along very well
in that privacy sort of safety sort of
thing that they could marry very much. I
mean, it it's even more apparent to me
that Anthropic should be bought by Apple
now cuz with uh open-source and a I mean
they're doing what's the what's the
phrase that they that has been used?
Scorched earth. They're going about this
in a scorched earth sort of way. you
know, like uh what Zuckerberg was trying
to do by releasing Llama as a open
source, even though we all know that uh
Llama is literally the worst. It's the
worst. It's so
>> I thought their three was doing pretty
good and then they came out with their
four and that was underwhelming.
>> Oh, and they overfit. They overfit for
the chat arena and it screwed them
because they knew that they were falling
behind. Uh they just knew it. They
didn't have the resour and they had the
resources.
>> Oh yeah, the Zuckerberg's like offering
people like these crazy multi-million
dollar contracts.
>> Not multi-million. There's a guy uh over
Yeah. a one billion with a incentive of
a hund a billion and a half over four
years. That's that's that's messy money,
you know? That's like the soccer player
messy money. That's
>> anyway. All right, Joseph. Uh, this has
been awesome. And literally, people have
been hanging here the whole time
watching us do this. Thank you. You 27
people that, uh, that stuck around for
the entire thing. This has been a joy.
We're gonna have every when we have big
releases or we have big weeks like this,
Joe, I'm gonna have to have you back, my
man. I mean, seriously. And we're gonna
have to we're gonna have to like
seriously talk about uh what the hell. I
mean the and it's everyone understand
this is the worst it's ever going to be.
All right. This is the worst that it's
ever going to be. And all of this, every
single moment of this was brought to you
by the Future Fiction Academy. Make sure
you check out our August accelerator for
$249 a month. Check out our standalone
classes. Check out your first draft. And
the best way for you to get your hands
on an ability to create your own first
draft right there, right then, made by
this guy right here. Right. Well, you
the the best way that you can do that is
to get into our YFD boot camp, which
gets you four credits and a class that
teaches you comprehensively how to make
your first draft with artificial
intelligence. This particular artificial
intelligence inside of your first draft.
Hey, Joseph, are you excited about the
possibility of uh adding um the o the
open- source models and stuff like that?
I am actually and I mean I'm definitely
excited about GPT5, but the OSS ones I
actually am a little bit more excited
about just because it seems like
performance to price it's really
impressive.
>> Yeah.
>> I mean not that you know a buck 25 or
whatever for GPT5 is bad but oh my god
