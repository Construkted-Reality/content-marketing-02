Photogrammetry:
I am looking for a list of blog post ideas based on real user pain points, which I can use as marketing content on my company blog to bring people to the website. 
Please search through comments on reddit, x, facebook and other forums for user problems users are asking for help on.

The main general topic for research is: photogrammetry
Construkted Reality can host the final models, but we are writing blog post article to provide solutions to the problems most users are experiencing ranging (but not inclusive of) photography, processing, and all and any steps in the photogrammetry workflow.

Include the following sections in your response for each suggested idea:
Pain Point: Describe the problem/pain point the user is experiencing in a lot of detail. Be verbose. We don't want to leave out any details.
Target Audience: Describe the type of users who have the described pain points/problems and who will most benefit from a solution.
Content Details: Describe the solution with enough detail so that I can craft entire blog posts from your summaries. Be verbose in your description. We don't want to miss any details.
Sopurce: this section lists all the URLs for source materials.
Reference Context: generate a very detailed summary of each source you use in your research. All details pertaining to specific pain point/problem and solution pertaining to main research topic should be captured here.
Separate all the blog post ideas with --- separator.
Use the following format:
## [Blog Post Title]
**Pain Point:** [Description of user problem]

**Content Details:** [Detailed solution description]
**Sources:**

THE KNOWLEDGE BASE: CONSTRUKTED REALITY
This is your foundational context. All responses must be filtered through this lens.
### A. Platform & Vision
What We Do: An open-access, web-based platform that democratizes 3D data. We empower anyone, from global enterprises to individual creators, to easily manage, visualize, and collaborate on rich digital worlds, all from a standard web browser.
Construkted Reality is the open-access hub where anyone can manage, explore, and collaborate with 3D data—no special tools or expertise required, and where management of geospatial data is simple.
Mission: To connect people through the power of shared 3D exploration and creativity.
Vision: To build a global community united by a user-generated digital Earth.
Core Problem Solved: We fix data fragmentation, inaccessibility, and difficult collaboration for anyone working with geospatial 3D data.
### B. Core Product
Assets: The foundational, un-modified 3D data files with rich metadata (geo-location, capture date, etc.).
Projects: Collaborative workspaces where teams can layer multiple Assets, adding annotations, measurements, and communication without altering the originals. Stories can be crafted through the ability to create presentations around the 3d data and annotations. All is done through a collaborative editing environment.
Construkted Globe: Our community centerpiece; a dynamic virtual globe showcasing all public user Assets. We are building more than a tool; we are building a new kind of map. The Construkted Globe is our interactive, virtual Earth that showcases every public Asset shared by our users. It’s a place for exploration, inspiration, and a visual testament to our community's collective effort to digitally document the world. 
(The Construkted Globe feature is currently in an early stage of development. Lets not talk much about it)
### C. Strategic Pillars
Current Monetization Streams: Tiered subscriptions (Hobbyist/Pro/Enterprise), and storage.
Future Planned Monetization Streams: Marketplace for asset sales (commission, subscription access)
