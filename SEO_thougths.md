**"Please apply the following on-page SEO best practices as you write the blog post. The primary keyword is [Your Primary Keyword] and secondary keywords are [Your Secondary Keywords].

Keyword Integration: Incorporate the primary keyword naturally in the main title (H1), the first 100 words, and at least one H2 subheading. Weave the secondary keywords throughout the body content where they fit contextually. Avoid keyword stuffing.
Structure & Headings: Structure the content with a clear hierarchy. Use H2 tags for the main sections of the blog post and H3 tags for any sub-points within those sections. Ensure headings are engaging and informative.
Readability & User Experience: Write in a clear and accessible style. Use short paragraphs (2-3 sentences), bullet points, and numbered lists to break up the text and make it easy for readers to scan.
Meta Elements: After the blog post, provide a suggested SEO Title Tag (under 60 characters) and a Meta Description (under 160 characters). The meta description should be an engaging summary that entices users to click from a search results page."**

SEO Guidelines: Write the article as if it will be published on a public website and apply the following SEO best‑practice rules.

Primary keyword – Identify the most important keyword phrase (3‑5 words) that matches the user’s intent and incorporate it once in the title, once in the first 100 words, and naturally 2‑3 more times throughout the body.
Secondary keywords & LSI terms – Sprinkle 3‑5 related terms or synonyms (latent semantic indexing keywords) where they fit naturally.
Title & Heading hierarchy – Produce a compelling, click‑worthy title (≈ 60 characters) that includes the primary keyword. Use H2 and H3 headings that are concise, keyword‑rich, and follow a logical flow.
Meta description – Generate a concise meta description (≈ 150‑160 characters) that includes the primary keyword and a clear call‑to‑action.
First‑paragraph hook – Begin with a hook that answers the user’s query and places the primary keyword early.
Readability – Keep sentences ≤ 20 words, use active voice, and break up long paragraphs. Aim for a Flesch‑Kincaid reading level of 8th‑grade or easier.
Internal & external links – Suggest 1‑2 internal links to other relevant posts on the site (placeholder URLs are fine) and 1‑2 authoritative external links that support facts or data.
Image alt text – For every suggested image, provide a brief alt‑text description that includes a relevant keyword or phrase.
Keyword density & natural flow – Ensure the primary keyword appears ≈ 1 % – 1.5 % of the total word count and that all keywords are used naturally (no stuffing).
Schema hint – If the topic fits, note a suitable schema type (e.g., FAQPage, Article, HowTo) that could be added later.

-count the number of words for each first and second prompt to get an idea of how many tokens we are sending.
  - set token count to a value that matches so as to not have the ai forget the begining of the prompts that we are sending.
  - the ai call prompts do not include all the text that has been scraped.
- write a deep-research python script to do the deep research locally.
  - envoke it once to get a list of ideas (like I'm curently doing with Perplexity) to generate a list of ideas based on a generic prompts, then run the same deep-research code on each of the ideas to deeply research them before writing a blog post.
