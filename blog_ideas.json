Although the Structure‑From‑Motion stage reports successful camera reconstruction (164 cameras), the final mesh is either empty or contains only a few triangles (e.g., 99 triangles vs. a normal mesh of ~326 k triangles). The main cause appears to be a lack of detectable features on the specimens, likely due to:\n\n- Insufficient depth of field when photographing from the side (features are blurred).\n- The subject occupies too little of the image; the user cannot get closer because of the camera’s minimum focal distance.\n- No focus stacking was performed, so only a thin plane is in focus.\n\nComments from the Meshroom maintainer (msanta) suggest checking the feature‑detection view (the three‑dot icon) and confirm that many features are detected. The user’s screenshots show very few features on the problematic images.\n\nSuggested remedies:\n\n1. Increase the size of the specimen in the frame (use macro lenses or move the camera closer if possible).\n2. Use focus stacking to bring the entire depth of the specimen into focus, thereby providing more sharp features.\n3. Improve lighting and reduce motion blur to enhance feature detection.\n4. Ensure high overlap between consecutive images (60‑80%).\n5. Consider using a higher‑resolution camera or reducing the aperture (higher f‑number) to increase depth of field.\n6.

          "text": "# Troubleshooting Agisoft Metashape: Top 10 Common Errors and How to Fix Them\n\n**Posted on 04/08/2025 by admin**\n\nAgisoft Metashape is a powerful photogrammetry tool—but even the most experienced users sometimes run into issues. From alignment failures to texture errors, knowing how to troubleshoot common problems can save you hours of frustration. In this guide we cover the top 10 errors in Metashape and how to fix them step by step.\n\n## 1. Photo Alignment Failed\n**Cause:** Poor image overlap, motion blur, inconsistent lighting, or metadata mismatch.\n**Solution:** Ensure at least 70–80 % overlap between photos. Avoid blurry or overexposed images. Set *Accuracy* to “Medium” and enable *Generic Preselection*.\n\n## 2. Processing Crashes or Freezes\n**Cause:** Not enough RAM, CPU overload, or GPU driver issues.\n**Solution:** Reduce photo resolution or chunk size. Use *Region clipping*. Check GPU settings under *Tools → Preferences → GPU* and keep drivers up‑to‑date.\n\n## 3. “Empty” Dense Cloud or Mesh\n**Cause:** Misalignment or no depth maps generated due to low feature quality.\n**Solution:** Rebuild depth maps with *High quality* and *Mild filtering*. Verify the bounding box contains the scene.\n\n## 4. Orthomosaic Not Generated or Blank\n**Cause:** Missing DEM, unreferenced chunk, or incorrect projection system.\n**Solution:** First generate a **DEM** from the dense cloud. Ensure the chunk is georeferenced and the EPSG code is correct.\n\n## 5. “Cannot Build Model: No Depth Maps”\n**Cause:** Depth maps weren’t generated, or were deleted after a crash.\n**Solution:** Rebuild depth maps via *Workflow → Build Depth Maps*. Avoid *Ultra High* quality unless necessary.\n\n## 6. Misaligned Cameras or Sparse Point Cloud Errors\n**Cause:** Bad image overlap, missing EXIF/GPS data, or wrong lens calibration.\n**Solution:** Manually remove outlier cameras, use *Reset Alignment* on problematic groups, or run camera calibration manually.\n\n## 7. “Can’t Load Texture” or Blank Textures\n**Cause:** File path issues, low‑res texture settings, or corrupted UV mapping.\n**Solution:** Use *Mosaic blending* with texture size 4096 or higher. Rebuild texture and ensure the mesh has proper UVs.\n\n## 8. GCP Errors Too High\n**Cause:** Incorrect coordinate input, bad marker placement, or scale mismatch.\n**Solution:** Double‑check GCP coordinates and units. Manually adjust marker positions and optimize alignment. Review the RMS error after optimization.\n\n## 9. “Out of Memory” Errors\n**Cause:** Chunk size or resolution too high for available RAM.\n**Solution:** Split the project into smaller chunks. Lower mesh quality. Use a tiled model workflow for large areas. Consider upgrading to 64 GB + RAM for very large datasets.\n\n## 10. Exported Model Appears Distorted\n**Cause:** Wrong scale, misaligned coordinate system, or export format mismatch.\n**Solution:** Use *Tools → Convert* to change model scale or orientation. Verify the coordinate reference system before exporting (.OBJ, .FBX, .PLY, etc.).\n\n### Bonus Tips to Avoid Problems\n- Always save backups before major steps.\n- Use the **Console** tab to debug processing errors.\n- Keep Metashape updated (latest stable release).\n- Employ **Python scripting** to standardize your workflow and avoid manual errors.\n\n## Conclusion\nPhotogrammetry can be complex—but troubleshooting doesn’t have to be. With these solutions to common Agisoft Metashape errors you can process datasets more efficiently, reduce frustration, and achieve high‑quality results with confidence.

          "text": "# lighting underground / interior advice please\n\n**Original post by marcusrjc2:**\n\nI am wanting to study lighting requirements for underground photogrammetry for a surveying dissertation / project. I will be using an underground mine so I can eliminate natural light and have full control. I am hoping to test angles and arrays of lights to test accuracy compared to a laser scan control, using photoscan and cloudcompare software. I have found little research on this and I know diffuse light is advised to eliminate shadows. I would be using 20w LED site (builders) lights with a 120 degree beam. I am hoping to test using these lights at 90 degrees/perpendicular to a wall and then vary this angle with lights either side of a section of wall. I believe varying this angle may vary detail and accuracy of point clouds. I would use multiple lights as I imagine the lighting can't change and so the next section of wall would have to be lit as I move along and then reposition redundant lights. I would also be testing the number of light sources for accuracy, e.g. left, right, top, bottom. Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated as I am relatively new to photogrammetry.\n\n---\n\n**Reply #1 by bigben:**\n\nWhat size tunnel? What angle lens? Camera pointing along tunnel or perpendicular to walls? Texture or just geometry?\n\n---\n\n**Reply #2 by marcusrjc2:**\n\nThe tunnel is about 6 m across and 5 m high. It's a hard rock (granite) mine. Initially I would just photograph one side wall. I haven't tested a camera yet in this situation to know the lens angle I'd need. I have tested outdoors and am aware that I need overlap and need to vary camera angles – I've been using about 90 degrees between camera positions on the same area and getting good results. I would be shooting approximately perpendicular to the walls but varying camera angles as described above, so really 45 degrees. I'd light an area with 2 lights either side of the area to be photographed and possibly one centrally at a low level. I would need the adjacent sections of the tunnel lit so lighting remains constant on the central section I am photographing. I should be then able to move down the tunnel by moving the first set of lights without affecting the area photographed. It's the angle of these lights to the wall that I'd like to test for any variation in accuracy of the final point cloud. I am thinking that although you don't want harsh shadows where the dynamic range of the camera won't pick up details, is there an optimal angle? Does the photogrammetry process need some shadowing to pick up texture or improve how the software picks up corresponding points? I would like to laser scan the same area and compare point clouds using CloudCompare by having ground control points to georeference. I am a surveying student, hence access to the mine and laser scanner. I have a background in photography, from quite a while ago. As mentioned, photogrammetry is new to me and would be interested to know if this is worth testing and if this methodology is ok.\n\n---\n\n**Reply #3 by marcusrjc2:**\n\nI should add that when I refer to area to be photographed, that may be about 5 m of tunnel/wall (depending on lens angle) with lights either side and a number of camera angles and overlapping photographs.\n\n---\n\n**Reply #4 by Marcel:**\n\nI think the lighting should be as consistent as possible, so either place the lights at a distance and keep them static (if they are strong enough) or set them up with the exact same angle relative to the camera. Photoscan doesn't need shadow detail specifically; any fine detail will do. Harsh shadows are indeed bad, because often the camera doesn't have enough range to get enough detail in the shadows (or highlights start clipping). If you photograph a wall you do not need to vary the angles, just varying the position will do. Position variations give Photoscan more information than camera rotation. Image quality is everything, so use a tripod and a remote release cord, and check your photos afterwards and remove the blurry ones.\n\n---\n\n**Reply #5 by bigben:**\n\nI've processed some images shot in long caves. Even with these configurations, a good model of a tunnel would have been possible if they also took photos traveling in the reverse direction. If the constant banding isn't an issue (i.e., geometry is more important than texture) full‑frame fisheye perpendicular to walls. Lights ahead and behind along the axis of the tunnel providing light from both sides to reduce shadows could be one option.\n\n---\n\n**Reply #6 by marcusrjc2:**\n\nMany thanks for thoughts on this. Apart from practicality of using a fisheye, I'm assuming as it will enable fewer photographs, are there any other advantages? I will be using static lights and a tripod. I'm still guessing that minor shadow detail, just to improve texture, may affect results? Guess I will just have to try. Another thing to test would be the workflow with regard to number of lights. So the more the better if they are static as more even lighting and less moving of lights. Moving down a tunnel I'd light areas 1, 2, and 3; photograph area 2; then move area 1 lights to area 4 and photograph area 3 if that makes sense! Hence just trying a wall to start with. I'd try the whole tunnel later.",

          "text": "# How do you manage lighting conditions for optimal photogrammetry results?\n\nManaging lighting for photogrammetry can be challenging, but with the right approach, you can capture images that are rich in detail and suitable for creating accurate 3D models. Photogrammetry, the science of making measurements from photographs, requires consistent lighting to ensure that the details of the subject are clearly visible and can be accurately mapped by software. Whether you're working indoors or outdoors, understanding how to control and manipulate light will significantly impact the quality of your photogrammetric results.\n\n## 1 Indoor Setup\nWhen working indoors, you have more control over lighting conditions. Use diffused light sources to minimize shadows and highlights, which can confuse photogrammetry software. Softboxes or diffusers can be placed strategically around your subject to create an even distribution of light. Additionally, ensure that the lighting is consistent across all the photographs you take, as variations can lead to inaccuracies in the resulting 3D model.\n\n## 2 Outdoor Challenges\nOutdoor photogrammetry presents unique challenges due to the changing position of the sun and weather conditions. Aim to conduct your photo sessions during the golden hours—shortly after sunrise or before sunset—when the light is soft and diffused. Overcast days can also provide good conditions by filtering sunlight and reducing shadows. However, always be prepared to adapt to sudden changes in natural lighting.\n\n## 3 Light Positioning\nThe positioning of light sources is critical in photogrammetry. Place lights at angles that illuminate the subject without causing glare or overly harsh shadows. If possible, use multiple light sources to cover different angles, reducing the number of unlit areas that could lead to data loss in the final model. The goal is to achieve a flat lighting setup that provides clear visibility of surface details without distortion.\n\n## 4 Color Temperature\nUnderstanding color temperature is essential for photogrammetry. Different light sources emit light at different color temperatures, measured in Kelvin (K). For consistent results, use lights with the same color temperature or set your camera's white balance to compensate for any variations. This ensures that the colors in your photographs are accurate and that the software can interpret the images correctly.\n\n## 5 Reflective Surfaces\nDealing with reflective surfaces can be tricky in photogrammetry. To manage reflections, consider using polarizing filters on your camera lens, which can reduce glare and help capture the true surface details. Additionally, you might want to use matte sprays or cloths to temporarily reduce the reflectiveness of shiny objects during the photogrammetry process.\n\n## 6 Camera Settings\nLastly, your camera settings play a significant role in managing lighting for photogrammetry. Use a low ISO to reduce noise, which can interfere with detail capture. Set a small aperture (high f‑stop number) for a deeper depth of field, ensuring that the entire subject is in focus. Adjust shutter speed to compensate for the light available, but use a tripod to avoid camera shake at slower speeds. These settings will help you maintain consistent exposure across all images.\n\n## 7 Here’s what else to consider\nThis is a space to share examples, stories, or insights that don’t fit into any of the previous sections. What else would you like to add?",

Because the article is meant to attract people who are just discovering the lighting issue, we place it at the top of the funnel (educational) and focus on troubleshooting.

          "text": "[Music]\ni want to try this out for a really long\ntime and today is the day i want to find\nout if a mobile phone is any good for\nphotogrammetry here's the intro\nin theory a phone should work perfectly\nfine photogrammetry is creating an\nobject out of multiple images so the\nlack of resolution from the small phone\nsensor is not as big of an issue of\ncourse that means shooting more images\nand more close-ups of the object that's\nthe only way to compete with the clarity\nof a big sensor camera for now though we\nwon't go overboard with the number of\nphotos taken we'll just focus on the\nbasics see what we can get out of a\nphone in order to properly capture an\nobject surface we need a polarizing\nfilter on both the lens and the light\nsource that ensures no reflections on\nthe surface of the object this will\nallow us to re-light the object later on\nwithout any issues i've covered that in\na previous video so if you haven't\nwatched that i'll leave a link in the\ndescription below\nto help with the whole reflection\nsituation i'll use the relatively\ndiffuse objects so the reflections won't\nbe that obvious we'll try three objects\na pinecone this wooden stick\nand this beautiful brick make no\nmistakes even these diffuse objects have\nreflections they're just not as visible\nas shiny reflective surfaces\nsince we want to compare the results\ni'll be shooting the objects twice once\nwith the iphone 11 pro and once with the\ngh5 it's an older phone but it's still\nable to capture a good amount of detail\nof course with a newer phone the results\nwill be better\nlet's start\nfor lighting the object i'm going very\nsimple i'll take advantage of the\nnatural light and to fill out the\nremaining shadows i'll use an led light\nwith neutral white balance\nto reduce the harsh shadows of the sun\nand make everything as soft as possible\nwe need a diffuser\nthankfully my currents are white so\nthey're the ultimate light diffuser\nnow let's start taking some pictures\nright off the bat i've hit the first\nsnag iphone's default lens is way too\nwide for landscapes it's perfect but for\nphotogrammetry not so much\nswitching to the 2x telephoto lens\nsolves a problem but the quality there\nis not as good\niphone's telephoto lens is not as bright\nand also has a lower quality ccd so the\nimages won't be as good as the ones\ntaken with a default lens\nthe images will be noisier and won't\nhave a ton of detail but on the other\nhand that's all we've got so that's what\nwe're going to use\nthe other interesting challenge was\nfinding a way to prop up the phone\nputting the phone on a tripod would move\nit too far away from the object so i\nended up using a combination of a tripod\nhead and some lens caps\na really professional setup but it does\na trick so i'm fine with it\nmy other concern was camera shake since\ni can't remotely trigger the shutter i\nhave to manually press the button on the\nscreen which can result in blurry images\nbut this is where the decision to not\nshoot with polarized light helps a lot\nwith plenty of natural light further\nenhanced by the led light the phone\nwon't have to use slow shutter speeds\nbut if we did shoot things the proper\nway i'm not exactly sure how i would be\nable to compensate for camera shake\nthe other issue with low light\nenvironments is that apple's night mode\ngets enabled and we definitely don't\nwant that night mode does a lot of post\nprocessing which compromises the quality\nof the image it aggressively reduces\nnoise and over sharpens the image to\ngive the illusion of detail so it's\ndefinitely not something we want to\nintroduce to our images\ni've covered apple's night mode in a\nprevious video so i'll leave that in the\ndescription below as well\nthe only way i can think of shooting\nwith a phone and cross polarized light\nis to have multiple light sources for\nadequate light but also polarizing\nfilters for all of these lights at that\npoint having spent this much money on\nequipment i don't know why anyone would\nuse a phone for the actual shoot but\nthat's besides the point let's get back\nto our shoot\nit's very important to lock the exposure\nand focus otherwise each image will be\ncompletely different than the last one\nthrowing things out of whack\nthe process is a bit tedious but with\nthe rotations of the object handled\nautomatically it's not as bad\n[Music]\nnow that the iphone photos are complete\nit's time to shoot the same thing all\nover again with the camera things are\nmuch easier here because there's a lot\nmore flexibility we can use a tripod\nchange lenses basically set up the shot\nexactly like we want to\n[Music]\nand with the phone cameras photos ready\nit's time for some processing\na few minutes later\nand here are the results\ni won't tell you which is which right\naway have a guess\nthe objects as far as overall shape goes\nare identical there are some differences\nin color and detail but both look really\ngood the left cone compared to the right\none looks like it has a blurrier texture\nbut that's only if you see the cone side\nby side if i disable the right one and\ninspect cone number one on its own the\ntexture feels really nice\nso\nwhich is which\ncone number two the one on the right\nside is the one made with the iphone and\ncone number one is down with the gh5 you\nmight be impressed by how much detail is\non the iphone texture but this detail is\nall artificial it's just the iphone\nbeing very aggressive with sharpening\nyou can tell quite easily if we take a\nlook at the bottom of the cone if we\nzoom in what looked like a lot of detail\nnow looks more like a posterized\naggressive sharpening\ncone number one's texture feels much\nmore natural and on the plus side if we\nwant to sharpen the result we can i'll\njust apply a non-sharp mask in photoshop\nand now we have a really sharp result\nand if we apply that to our cone we have\na sharp result that still looks way more\nnatural than the one from the iphone\nthat's the good thing with images taken\nwith a camera the results are very\nneutral and we can fine tune them the\nway we want to after the fact with a\nphone we're getting a pre-decided result\nthat's always punchier and more\nprocessed\nin hindsight i should have used raw for\nthe iphone's images since no pause\nprocessing is applied there but that\nwould also involve one extra step\nconverting the raw images to jpeg in\norder to use them for photogrammetry now\nlet's move on to the next object\nboth look good as far as form goes which\nis quite encouraging it means that the\nimages had enough detail to accurately\ndescribe the object so judging by the\nform alone it's not easy to tell which\nis which if we turn on the textures\nthough it's quite obvious which one is\ntaken with the iphone and which one is\nwith the gh5\nas with the previous object the one that\nlooks more detailed is the one taken\nwith the iphone but like before the\ndetail is an illusion if we zoom in\ncloser you will notice how much the\ntexture falls apart the one taking with\nthe gh5 object number two feels very\nnatural\nonce more the gh5s less aggressive\nsharpening and higher resolution gives\nbetter results and once we apply some\nsharpening to the image we get some nice\nsharp details\nthe other dead giveaway is the white\nbalance of the texture\niphones ever since i can remember always\nlean into the yellow end of the spectrum\nthe photos taken with the gh5 have a\nmore correct and neutral white balance\nthe yellowish white balance though can\nbe fixed relatively easily so at least\nthe result in that regard can be\nadjusted\nno matter what though the iphone result\nis quite impressive especially if we\nconsider the fact that a phone's primary\nfunction is phone calls and messaging\nnot photogrammetry in that regard this\nresult is mind-blowing\nand last but not least our final object\nthis beautifully disgusting brick\nignore this fail the scan part that was\nan error on my side\ni'm sure by now you can tell which model\nis done with which camera number one is\ndone with the iphone and number two with\na gh5\nhere the over sharpening went a little\nbit too crazy i might have also\nunderexposed the iphone images a tad\ni'm not sure though if this is my fault\nno matter what though the over\nsharpening makes the model look\nunrealistic\nthe one shot with the gh5 looks much\nmore natural if we compare the images\nside by side you can see how aggressive\nthe iphone is with the sharpening\nso if you're planning to shoot something\nwith your phone definitely shoot it with\nraw and not with a default camera\nthis will ensure that no pause\nprocessing is applied it will add one\nextra step in the process but the\nresults will be infinitely\nbetter so\nwhat's the verdict\ni would say if we take the proper steps\nand ensure lots of light and raw\nshooting we can get some nice looking\nobjects from a phone\nbut we definitely need to be more\ncareful than with an ordinary camera raw\nis an absolute must in order to avoid\npost processing and any other modes like\napple's night mode\ncross polarization with a phone is a tad\ntrickier not only because of the\npolarizing filter for the phone's lens\nbut also because of the higher noise\nfloor of the phone's small ccd chip\nunless we have adequate lights and\nfilters\nwith newer phones i'm sure the results\nwill be even better iphone 13's macro\nlens for example might be able to\ncapture a lot more detail\ndon't forget that more detail means\nbetter forms and richer textures\nis my iphone going to replace my camera\nfor photogrammetry definitely not\nbut it's good to know that if you're in\na pinch and you're willing to follow\nsome basic rules you will be able to get\nsome good results out of it\nand that's about it for this video how\ndo you think the iphone fared would you\npersonally use your phone to do this\nsort of thing let me know in the\ncomments below take care and i'll see\nyou in the next one",

I'm currently using Meshroom, MeshLab, and Fusion as software. I'm using a Google Pixel 8 to take photos of my object (currently a Lego bird). I took about 100 photos circling around the object, keeping the same zoom. Although as you can see from the image, it's pretty bad. Any tips with using cell phones in general for 3D models would be great. Obviously they're going to have different specs for different cameras, but I'm pretty new to this so I'm not quite sure how I accommodate that in Meshroom.",

This problem is particularly prevalent when flying at low altitudes over terrain with elevation changes, or when operators use automated flight settings of 30-60% overlap without understanding the implications. The result is incomplete 3D reconstructions, holes in orthomosaics, and unusable data that requires expensive re-flights. Users describe frustration when photogrammetry software like DJI Terra or Pix4D excludes images automatically due to insufficient tie points, leaving them with partial coverage of their intended mapping area.

Users report scenarios where horizontal accuracy meets expectations (within 2-3 cm), but vertical measurements vary by 10-30 cm or more across the same project site. This problem manifests as inconsistent elevation readings between different areas of the same survey, making it impossible to apply uniform vertical corrections without compromising areas that check out correctly. The issue becomes particularly problematic when surveying new construction sites with clean reference points like curb tops, manholes, and utility infrastructure where precision is critical for design and construction workflows. Operators describe frustration when half of their control points show acceptable accuracy while others are off by several tenths of a foot, creating an impossible situation for quality assurance and project delivery. This vertical accuracy variability increases with project size, becoming more pronounced on sites larger than 200 acres, and affects both photogrammetry and LiDAR workflows.",

The Zenmuse L1 discussion reveals that larger project sites amplify accuracy variations, with users experiencing systematic errors that optimization algorithms in processing software sometimes worsen rather than improve. Professional surveyors emphasize that GPS-based accuracy inherently limits vertical precision to approximately ±10mm at best, which degrades further with processing steps, making traditional total station methods still necessary for high-precision applications requiring millimeter-level accuracy in construction layout and infrastructure projects.",
