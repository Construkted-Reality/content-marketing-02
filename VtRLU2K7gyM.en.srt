[Music]

2
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,720
i want to try this out for a really long

3
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,560
time and today is the day i want to find

4
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:10,320
out if a mobile phone is any good for

5
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,320
photogrammetry here's the intro

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,360
in theory a phone should work perfectly

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,359
fine photogrammetry is creating an

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,960
object out of multiple images so the

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,840
lack of resolution from the small phone

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,680
sensor is not as big of an issue of

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,080
course that means shooting more images

12
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,760
and more close-ups of the object that's

13
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,560
the only way to compete with the clarity

14
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,480
of a big sensor camera for now though we

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,640
won't go overboard with the number of

16
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,880
photos taken we'll just focus on the

17
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,879
basics see what we can get out of a

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,040
phone in order to properly capture an

19
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,520
object surface we need a polarizing

20
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,000
filter on both the lens and the light

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,760
source that ensures no reflections on

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,680
the surface of the object this will

23
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,160
allow us to re-light the object later on

24
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,680
without any issues i've covered that in

25
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,440
a previous video so if you haven't

26
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,199
watched that i'll leave a link in the

27
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,559
description below

28
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,719
to help with the whole reflection

29
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,760
situation i'll use the relatively

30
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,799
diffuse objects so the reflections won't

31
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:09,360
be that obvious we'll try three objects

32
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,320
a pinecone this wooden stick

33
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:15,040
and this beautiful brick make no

34
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,360
mistakes even these diffuse objects have

35
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,159
reflections they're just not as visible

36
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,920
as shiny reflective surfaces

37
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,479
since we want to compare the results

38
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,400
i'll be shooting the objects twice once

39
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,960
with the iphone 11 pro and once with the

40
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,360
gh5 it's an older phone but it's still

41
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,200
able to capture a good amount of detail

42
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,720
of course with a newer phone the results

43
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,000
will be better

44
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,840
let's start

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,439
for lighting the object i'm going very

46
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,040
simple i'll take advantage of the

47
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,280
natural light and to fill out the

48
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,600
remaining shadows i'll use an led light

49
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,680
with neutral white balance

50
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,159
to reduce the harsh shadows of the sun

51
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,920
and make everything as soft as possible

52
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,600
we need a diffuser

53
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,560
thankfully my currents are white so

54
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,880
they're the ultimate light diffuser

55
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,640
now let's start taking some pictures

56
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,680
right off the bat i've hit the first

57
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,399
snag iphone's default lens is way too

58
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,200
wide for landscapes it's perfect but for

59
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,120
photogrammetry not so much

60
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,879
switching to the 2x telephoto lens

61
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,560
solves a problem but the quality there

62
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,640
is not as good

63
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,280
iphone's telephoto lens is not as bright

64
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,360
and also has a lower quality ccd so the

65
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,440
images won't be as good as the ones

66
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,599
taken with a default lens

67
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,000
the images will be noisier and won't

68
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,160
have a ton of detail but on the other

69
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,680
hand that's all we've got so that's what

70
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,200
we're going to use

71
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,519
the other interesting challenge was

72
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,280
finding a way to prop up the phone

73
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,519
putting the phone on a tripod would move

74
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,760
it too far away from the object so i

75
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,480
ended up using a combination of a tripod

76
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,160
head and some lens caps

77
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,480
a really professional setup but it does

78
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,200
a trick so i'm fine with it

79
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,959
my other concern was camera shake since

80
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,640
i can't remotely trigger the shutter i

81
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,440
have to manually press the button on the

82
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,200
screen which can result in blurry images

83
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,159
but this is where the decision to not

84
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,560
shoot with polarized light helps a lot

85
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,560
with plenty of natural light further

86
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,720
enhanced by the led light the phone

87
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,120
won't have to use slow shutter speeds

88
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,280
but if we did shoot things the proper

89
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,680
way i'm not exactly sure how i would be

90
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,120
able to compensate for camera shake

91
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,360
the other issue with low light

92
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,760
environments is that apple's night mode

93
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,640
gets enabled and we definitely don't

94
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,400
want that night mode does a lot of post

95
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,560
processing which compromises the quality

96
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,560
of the image it aggressively reduces

97
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,319
noise and over sharpens the image to

98
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,920
give the illusion of detail so it's

99
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,840
definitely not something we want to

100
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,680
introduce to our images

101
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,000
i've covered apple's night mode in a

102
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,400
previous video so i'll leave that in the

103
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
description below as well

104
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,080
the only way i can think of shooting

105
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
with a phone and cross polarized light

106
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,080
is to have multiple light sources for

107
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,120
adequate light but also polarizing

108
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,799
filters for all of these lights at that

109
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,959
point having spent this much money on

110
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,200
equipment i don't know why anyone would

111
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,959
use a phone for the actual shoot but

112
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,239
that's besides the point let's get back

113
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,480
to our shoot

114
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,040
it's very important to lock the exposure

115
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,720
and focus otherwise each image will be

116
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,959
completely different than the last one

117
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,879
throwing things out of whack

118
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,480
the process is a bit tedious but with

119
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:18,120
the rotations of the object handled

120
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:28,960
automatically it's not as bad

121
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:30,720
[Music]

122
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,400
now that the iphone photos are complete

123
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,800
it's time to shoot the same thing all

124
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,800
over again with the camera things are

125
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,199
much easier here because there's a lot

126
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,600
more flexibility we can use a tripod

127
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,880
change lenses basically set up the shot

128
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,880
exactly like we want to

129
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:49,930
[Music]

130
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,479
and with the phone cameras photos ready

131
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,560
it's time for some processing

132
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,320
a few minutes later

133
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,000
and here are the results

134
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,320
i won't tell you which is which right

135
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,280
away have a guess

136
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,440
the objects as far as overall shape goes

137
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,160
are identical there are some differences

138
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,320
in color and detail but both look really

139
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,479
good the left cone compared to the right

140
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,240
one looks like it has a blurrier texture

141
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,880
but that's only if you see the cone side

142
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,120
by side if i disable the right one and

143
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,080
inspect cone number one on its own the

144
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,280
texture feels really nice

145
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,800
so

146
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,320
which is which

147
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,479
cone number two the one on the right

148
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,520
side is the one made with the iphone and

149
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:39,360
cone number one is down with the gh5 you

150
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,919
might be impressed by how much detail is

151
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,160
on the iphone texture but this detail is

152
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,960
all artificial it's just the iphone

153
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,800
being very aggressive with sharpening

154
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,880
you can tell quite easily if we take a

155
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,199
look at the bottom of the cone if we

156
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,039
zoom in what looked like a lot of detail

157
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,120
now looks more like a posterized

158
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,280
aggressive sharpening

159
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,400
cone number one's texture feels much

160
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,960
more natural and on the plus side if we

161
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,199
want to sharpen the result we can i'll

162
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,080
just apply a non-sharp mask in photoshop

163
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,240
and now we have a really sharp result

164
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,400
and if we apply that to our cone we have

165
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,199
a sharp result that still looks way more

166
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,720
natural than the one from the iphone

167
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,479
that's the good thing with images taken

168
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,319
with a camera the results are very

169
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,720
neutral and we can fine tune them the

170
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,120
way we want to after the fact with a

171
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,440
phone we're getting a pre-decided result

172
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,800
that's always punchier and more

173
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,199
processed

174
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,520
in hindsight i should have used raw for

175
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,520
the iphone's images since no pause

176
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,520
processing is applied there but that

177
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,759
would also involve one extra step

178
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,400
converting the raw images to jpeg in

179
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:47,360
order to use them for photogrammetry now

180
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,840
let's move on to the next object

181
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,520
both look good as far as form goes which

182
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,759
is quite encouraging it means that the

183
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,560
images had enough detail to accurately

184
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,560
describe the object so judging by the

185
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,720
form alone it's not easy to tell which

186
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,479
is which if we turn on the textures

187
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,400
though it's quite obvious which one is

188
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,039
taken with the iphone and which one is

189
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,880
with the gh5

190
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,039
as with the previous object the one that

191
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,360
looks more detailed is the one taken

192
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,759
with the iphone but like before the

193
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,280
detail is an illusion if we zoom in

194
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,599
closer you will notice how much the

195
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:23,039
texture falls apart the one taking with

196
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,479
the gh5 object number two feels very

197
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,560
natural

198
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,880
once more the gh5s less aggressive

199
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,360
sharpening and higher resolution gives

200
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,360
better results and once we apply some

201
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,120
sharpening to the image we get some nice

202
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,960
sharp details

203
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,720
the other dead giveaway is the white

204
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,960
balance of the texture

205
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,919
iphones ever since i can remember always

206
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,680
lean into the yellow end of the spectrum

207
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:48,240
the photos taken with the gh5 have a

208
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,000
more correct and neutral white balance

209
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,400
the yellowish white balance though can

210
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,080
be fixed relatively easily so at least

211
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,199
the result in that regard can be

212
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,360
adjusted

213
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,440
no matter what though the iphone result

214
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,120
is quite impressive especially if we

215
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,759
consider the fact that a phone's primary

216
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,479
function is phone calls and messaging

217
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:09,199
not photogrammetry in that regard this

218
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:12,000
result is mind-blowing

219
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:15,039
and last but not least our final object

220
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,599
this beautifully disgusting brick

221
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:19,520
ignore this fail the scan part that was

222
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,680
an error on my side

223
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,160
i'm sure by now you can tell which model

224
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,919
is done with which camera number one is

225
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,759
done with the iphone and number two with

226
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,599
a gh5

227
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,000
here the over sharpening went a little

228
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:34,640
bit too crazy i might have also

229
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,560
underexposed the iphone images a tad

230
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,399
i'm not sure though if this is my fault

231
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,560
no matter what though the over

232
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,080
sharpening makes the model look

233
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,720
unrealistic

234
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,120
the one shot with the gh5 looks much

235
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,360
more natural if we compare the images

236
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:53,040
side by side you can see how aggressive

237
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,959
the iphone is with the sharpening

238
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,200
so if you're planning to shoot something

239
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,760
with your phone definitely shoot it with

240
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,200
raw and not with a default camera

241
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,120
this will ensure that no pause

242
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,720
processing is applied it will add one

243
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,839
extra step in the process but the

244
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,640
results will be infinitely

245
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,000
better so

246
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,720
what's the verdict

247
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,480
i would say if we take the proper steps

248
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,640
and ensure lots of light and raw

249
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,160
shooting we can get some nice looking

250
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,760
objects from a phone

251
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,720
but we definitely need to be more

252
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,480
careful than with an ordinary camera raw

253
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,480
is an absolute must in order to avoid

254
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,080
post processing and any other modes like

255
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,480
apple's night mode

256
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,920
cross polarization with a phone is a tad

257
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,000
trickier not only because of the

258
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,080
polarizing filter for the phone's lens

259
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,200
but also because of the higher noise

260
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,200
floor of the phone's small ccd chip

261
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,320
unless we have adequate lights and

262
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,000
filters

263
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,959
with newer phones i'm sure the results

264
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,880
will be even better iphone 13's macro

265
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,519
lens for example might be able to

266
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,120
capture a lot more detail

267
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,920
don't forget that more detail means

268
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,680
better forms and richer textures

269
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,320
is my iphone going to replace my camera

270
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,320
for photogrammetry definitely not

271
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,320
but it's good to know that if you're in

272
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,560
a pinch and you're willing to follow

273
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,279
some basic rules you will be able to get

274
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,800
some good results out of it

275
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,640
and that's about it for this video how

276
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,399
do you think the iphone fared would you

277
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,000
personally use your phone to do this

278
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,480
sort of thing let me know in the

279
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,959
comments below take care and i'll see

280
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,959
you in the next one
