# Product Context: Blog Post Idea Library System

## Why This Project Exists
The blog post idea library system addresses the need for a centralized, organized repository of blog post ideas derived from real user pain points. This system enables content creators to systematically collect, process, and manage blog post concepts from various research sources without duplication.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Data Fragmentation**: Blog post ideas were scattered across multiple markdown files without central organization
2. **Duplicate Content**: Risk of processing the same blog post ideas multiple times
3. **Manual Processing**: Time-consuming manual extraction and organization of blog post concepts
4. **Metadata Management**: Lack of structured approach to storing rich metadata about each blog idea
5. **Scalability**: Difficulty managing growing collections of blog post ideas

## How It Should Work
The system should:
- Accept markdown files with "---" separators as input
- Automatically parse and extract structured blog post data
- Detect and prevent duplicate entries
- Store all ideas in a persistent JSON database
- Support rich metadata fields for content categorization and tracking
- Provide a simple command-line interface for easy operation

## User Experience Goals
- Simple, intuitive command-line interface
- Clear feedback during processing
- Reliable duplicate detection
- Persistent storage that survives system restarts
- Extensible architecture for future enhancements
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
