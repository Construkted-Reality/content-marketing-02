# Active Context

## Current Work
Successfully integrated ScrapegraphAI into the `02_generate_blog_drafts.py` script to replace URL injection with actual web scraping. The implementation removes URL lists from LLM prompts and instead provides scraped text content, improving content grounding while maintaining clean source attribution.

## Recent Changes
- **ScrapegraphAI Integration**: Created `utils/scrape_sources.py` with SmartScraperGraph integration
- **Prompt Restructuring**: Replaced "Visit all URLs..." instructions with "Use the provided source excerpts"
- **Caching Implementation**: Added `scraped_sources` field to `blog_ideas.json` for persistent caching
- **Programmatic Sources**: Sources section now appended automatically outside LLM generation
- **Schema Updates**: Modified `01_process_blog_ideas.py` to include `scraped_sources: []` in new ideas

## Key Technical Concepts
- ScrapegraphAI SmartScraperGraph for LLM-assisted web scraping
- OpenAI-compatible API endpoint configuration for scraping
- Caching mechanism using JSON persistence
- Option A failure policy (continue on individual URL failures)
- Separation of content generation from source attribution
- Helper function architecture for modular scraping workflow

## Relevant Files and Code
- **File**: `utils/scrape_sources.py` (NEW)
  - Functions: `build_llm_env()`, `scrape_url()`, `scrape_urls()`
  - Uses local OpenAI endpoint (http://192.168.8.90:42069/v1) with model gpt-oss-120b
  - Implements comprehensive error handling and URL validation
  - Returns structured ScrapedSource dictionaries with status, text, char_count

- **File**: `02_generate_blog_drafts.py` (EXTENSIVELY MODIFIED)
  - Added helper functions: `get_or_build_scraped_sources()`, `build_source_excerpts()`, `build_idea_context()`, `add_sources_section_to_output()`
  - Modified `select_parameters()` and `generate_blog_post()` to use scraped excerpts
  - Updated `save_draft_and_update_json()` to append Sources section programmatically
  - Replaced manual idea content assembly with `build_idea_context()` function

- **File**: `01_process_blog_ideas.py` (MINOR UPDATES)
  - Added 'scraped_sources' to enriched_fields list
  - Added default `scraped_sources: []` initialization in both processing methods

## Problem Solving
- **URL Injection Issue**: Solved by replacing URL lists with scraped text excerpts in prompts
- **Content Grounding**: Improved by providing actual web content instead of asking LLM to "visit" URLs
- **Caching Strategy**: Implemented to avoid repeated network calls and improve performance
- **Import Issues**: Resolved correct import path for ScrapegraphAI (`from scrapegraphai.graphs import SmartScraperGraph`)
- **Dependency Management**: Used pipenv for proper virtual environment package installation

## Testing Results
- Successfully tested with idea ID `2a2ab6040f05`
- Scraped 3 source URLs and cached results in JSON
- Generated blog post using scraped content instead of URLs
- Programmatically added Sources section to final output
- LLM correctly evaluated Construkted Reality's suitability for the use case

## Next Steps
- Monitor scraping performance and error rates in production use
- Consider implementing retry logic for failed scrapes
- Evaluate need for rate limiting or request throttling
- Document scraping workflow for team members
