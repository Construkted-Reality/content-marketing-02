# Active Context

## Current Work
Updated the blog_idea_unified_processor.py file to add a "modified_at" field that works alongside the existing "created_at" field in the blog ideas processing system.

## Key Technical Concepts
- Python JSON processing with datetime timestamps
- Blog idea extraction and enrichment from markdown files
- Timestamp management for created and modified events
- File I/O operations for blog_ideas.json storage

## Relevant Files and Code
- **blog_idea_unified_processor.py**: Modified to set both `created_at` and `modified_at` timestamps when processing new blog ideas
- **blog_ideas.json**: Existing file structure that already contained `created_at` fields

## Problem Solving
The task required adding a "modified at" field to complement the existing "created at" field. The solution involved:
1. Identifying the exact location in the processor where timestamps are set
2. Adding the `modified_at` field alongside `created_at` 
3. Ensuring both fields use the same ISO timestamp format
4. Maintaining backward compatibility with existing functionality

## Pending Tasks and Next Steps
- Monitor the processor behavior with new blog idea processing
- Verify that existing entries in blog_ideas.json are not affected
- Test the complete workflow with sample markdown files
