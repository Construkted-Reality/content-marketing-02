# Active Context

## Current Work
Refactored the OpenAI API configuration in `02_generate_blog_drafts.py` to store only the IP address and build the full URL dynamically in the `post_api` function, mirroring the approach used for Ollama.

## Key Technical Concepts
- Modular configuration approach for API endpoints
- Dynamic URL construction using separate IP, port, and path components
- Consistent pattern matching between Ollama and OpenAI API configurations
- Python string formatting for URL construction

## Relevant Files and Code
- **File**: `02_generate_blog_drafts.py`
- **Changes**: 
  - Split `OPENAI_HOST` into `OPENAI_HOST_IP`, `OPENAI_PORT`, and `OPENAI_API_PATH`
  - Modified `post_api` function to dynamically construct OpenAI URL
  - Updated debug print statement to show constructed URL
  - Fixed variable references to eliminate undefined variable errors

## Problem Solving
- Identified and fixed Pylance errors related to undefined `OPENAI_HOST` variable
- Maintained backward compatibility while implementing the refactoring
- Ensured consistency with existing Ollama API pattern

## Next Steps
- Verify the refactored code works correctly with the OpenAI API
- Test that all API calls function as expected with the new configuration approach
- Document the change in project documentation
