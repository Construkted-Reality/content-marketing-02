# Implementation Notes - Length Parameter Support

## Overview
Implemented support for the "length" parameter in the blog generation pipeline to:
1. Return a target word count from the first Ollama API call
2. Store that length value in blog_ideas.json for each processed idea
3. Use the length value to guide the second Ollama API call's content generation

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified `02_generate_blog_drafts.py`

#### First API Call Enhancement (`select_parameters` function):
- Fixed JSON schema formatting by adding missing comma between "pain_point" and "length" fields
- Ensured the JSON output includes `"length": "Estimated number of words for the final article"`

#### Second API Call Enhancement (`generate_blog_post` function):
- Added `Target length: {selected['length']} words.` to the prompt to guide content generation

#### Data Storage Enhancement:
- The `update_idea_with_api_response` function already included "length" in its field processing list
- The `save_draft_and_update_json` function properly updates the JSON file with the length value

### 2. JSON Schema Correction
The original JSON schema had a formatting issue where the comma was missing between "pain_point" and "length" fields, which would have caused parsing errors. This was corrected to ensure proper JSON structure.

## How It Works

1. **First API Call**: Model returns JSON with "length" field containing estimated word count (800-3000)
2. **Data Processing**: Length value is stored in idea dictionary via `update_idea_with_api_response`
3. **File Update**: `save_draft_and_update_json` writes updated idea back to `blog_ideas.json`
4. **Second API Call**: Prompt includes "Target length: {length} words." to guide generation

## Verification
- The `blog_ideas.json` file now properly populates the "length" field for each processed idea
- Generated markdown drafts include length in metadata
- Both API calls properly utilize the length parameter
- Backward compatibility maintained

## Files Modified
- `02_generate_blog_drafts.py` - Core implementation
- `blog_ideas.json` - Contains the ideas data structure (no direct modification needed)

## Technical Details
The implementation leverages existing code patterns in the script:
- Uses the same field processing mechanism already in place for other fields
- Maintains the existing update logic flow
- Adds minimal, focused changes without disrupting existing functionality
