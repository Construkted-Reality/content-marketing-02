# Progress

## What Works
- The OpenAI API configuration in `02_generate_blog_drafts.py` has been successfully refactored
- The script now stores only the IP address and builds the full URL dynamically in the `post_api` function
- The approach mirrors the existing Ollama API pattern for consistency
- All Pylance errors related to undefined variables have been resolved
- Backward compatibility is maintained

## What's Left to Build
- No remaining tasks for this specific refactoring

## Current Status
The refactoring is complete and functional. The code now follows a consistent pattern for both Ollama and OpenAI API configurations.

## Known Issues
- None

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Initial implementation used a single `OPENAI_HOST` variable with full URL
- Refactored to use modular components (`IP`, `PORT`, `API_PATH`) for better maintainability
- This change aligns with the existing Ollama configuration pattern
