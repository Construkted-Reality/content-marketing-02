# Progress

## What Works
- Successfully modified blog_idea_unified_processor.py to add modified_at field
- Both created_at and modified_at timestamps are now set when processing new blog ideas
- Implementation maintains backward compatibility
- Existing blog_ideas.json structure remains intact

## What's Left to Build
- Test the complete workflow with actual markdown files
- Verify that existing entries in blog_ideas.json are not affected
- Monitor processor behavior with new blog idea processing

## Current Status
The core functionality has been implemented. The processor now sets both timestamps when creating new blog ideas, providing the foundation for tracking creation and modification times.

## Known Issues
- None identified at this time

## Evolution of Project Decisions
The decision to add both fields simultaneously was made to ensure consistency and provide immediate value for tracking when blog ideas are created and modified. This approach follows the existing code patterns and maintains the same timestamp format.
