# Progress

## What Works
- **ScrapegraphAI Integration**: Successfully integrated web scraping into `02_generate_blog_drafts.py`
- **URL Replacement**: Removed URL injection from LLM prompts and replaced with actual scraped content
- **Caching System**: Implemented persistent caching of scraped content in `blog_ideas.json`
- **Source Attribution**: Programmatic Sources section automatically appended to blog posts
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with Option A failure policy (continue on individual URL failures)
- **Schema Compatibility**: Updated `01_process_blog_ideas.py` to support `scraped_sources` field
- **Command-line Interface**: Enhanced with `--force_article_gen` and `--ideas_id` flags for flexible processing
- **Content Grounding**: Improved blog post quality by providing actual web content to LLMs
- **Production Ready**: Fully tested and confirmed working with real URLs and content extraction

## What's Left to Build
- No remaining tasks for the ScrapegraphAI integration
- Future enhancements could include:
  - Retry logic for failed scrapes
  - Rate limiting for respectful scraping
  - Additional scraping configuration options
  - Performance monitoring and metrics

## Current Status
The ScrapegraphAI integration is complete and fully functional. The system now:
- Scrapes source URLs using SmartScraperGraph with local OpenAI endpoint (http://192.168.8.90:42069/v1)
- Caches scraped content to avoid repeated network calls (verified with 6,158 characters cached)
- Provides scraped text excerpts to LLM prompts instead of URL lists
- Generates higher-quality blog posts with better content grounding
- Maintains clean source attribution through programmatic Sources sections
- Successfully handles partial failures (2/3 URLs succeeded in testing)

## Known Issues
- None currently identified
- Pylance shows import warning for scrapegraphai.graphs but functionality works correctly
- Some URLs (like Reddit) may not scrape well due to anti-bot measures, but system continues processing

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Initial Approach**: LLM prompts included raw URL lists with instructions to "visit URLs"
- **Problem Identified**: LLMs cannot actually visit URLs, leading to poor content grounding
- **Solution Implemented**: Integrated ScrapegraphAI to scrape URLs and provide actual content
- **Caching Added**: Implemented persistent caching to improve performance and reduce network calls
- **Architecture Decision**: Separated content generation from source attribution for cleaner implementation
- **Configuration Challenges**: Resolved ScrapegraphAI configuration issues with model provider settings
- **Playwright Dependencies**: Installed required browser dependencies for web scraping
- **Testing Validated**: Successfully tested with real URLs and confirmed improved content quality

## Final Test Results
**Test with idea ID `2a2ab6040f05`:**
- ✅ Successfully scraped 2 out of 3 source URLs
- ✅ Cached 6,158 characters of actual web content in JSON file
- ✅ Sample content: "How to Enhance 3D Scan Quality: Post-Processing Tips..."
- ✅ Generated blog post using scraped excerpts instead of URLs
- ✅ Programmatically added Sources section to final output
- ✅ Built source excerpts from successful scrapes for LLM prompts
- ✅ Option A failure policy working correctly (continued despite 1 failed URL)

## Recent Achievements
- Created `utils/scrape_sources.py` with comprehensive scraping functionality
- Modified `02_generate_blog_drafts.py` with new helper functions for scraping workflow
- Updated `01_process_blog_ideas.py` for schema compatibility
- Installed and configured scrapegraphai dependency with Playwright browsers
- Resolved configuration issues with model provider settings
- Successfully tested end-to-end workflow with idea ID `2a2ab6040f05`
- Verified actual text content is being cached in JSON file
- Updated documentation in memory bank and README
- Confirmed production-ready status with real-world testing
