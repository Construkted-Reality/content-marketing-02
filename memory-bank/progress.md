# Progress

## What Works
- The `02_generate_blog_drafts.py` script has been enhanced with a `--force_article_gen` command-line flag
- The script now properly checks the `article_generated` field in `blog_ideas.json` and skips already-generated ideas by default
- The force flag enables regeneration of drafts for ideas that have already been processed
- All existing functionality remains intact including API calls, file naming, and JSON updates
- Backward compatibility is maintained

## What's Left to Build
- No remaining tasks for this enhancement

## Current Status
The enhancement is complete and functional. The script now supports both selective processing (default) and forced regeneration modes.

## Known Issues
- None

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Initial implementation processed all ideas regardless of generation status
- Added `article_generated` flag checking to prevent redundant processing
- Implemented `--force_article_gen` flag to provide override capability
- This change enables more flexible workflow management for blog content generation
